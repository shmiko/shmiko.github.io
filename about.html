Otherwise:
This blog is just a bunch of posts about stuff I'm learning or that I have an interest in....

PS...My Day Job is actually as a Snr Business Analyst - but the title is nothing like what I really do there 
and I would love to get into a Top Notch Tech Company or Startup with the same aspirations and goals as I have.

I'm always looking to improve things and consider that the customer should be the core of all business concerns,  
and as such customer needs and wants should be fully considered to help align a business model.
Let me use my Customer Service knowledge and to help carve a niche for your business, 
and whilst I am technically capable I can mentor younger developers to maintain a high level of quality  
and enable a workplace which is sharing the common goals and principles of the business and strive for continued success.
