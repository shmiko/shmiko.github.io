## Wednesday 23rd 2015  

![USA](/img/travel.jpg)

Sorry for such a delay between updates, we have now been getting up at 5:30 ( yes that means the whole family not just me lol ) so as we can take advantage of Disney Early Hours which is a privilege to guests of the disney resorts where we get an extra hour before and after hours which the general public get excluded from, not that it make much difference...I will explain more later.

Today we are leaving Bakersfield to go to Magic Mountain 6 Flags where Jack and I have special Platinum passes which will allow us fast entry and 2 rides in a row. We arrived at about 9:30am and went and lines up. I chose the wrong line which was for special card holders only but by the time I realized it would have meant we rejoin the lines which were hundreds of people deep. So I purposely stayed in the line and figured I would talk my way in. An hour later they started letting people in from our queue and to no surprise they picked up that we were in the wrong line but I smoothed things over and persuaded them to let us go in as it would have meant another hour wait which would have been very bad as it was near freezing today with expected snow fall later in the day.
We needed to go to a special booth to convert our special tickets and get a digital device which allowed us to book certain rides to avoid wait times. This park was all about extreme roller coasters and I mean extreme as they are definitely not for the faint hearted.

First up was a ride called Viper which has been one of the tallest and fasest roller coasters in the world. It is a red and white massive steel structure which rises to 188 feet and has 7 loops and travells at 70 miles per hour first dropping 177 feet ( 14 stories high ) and then goes into the huge loops and corkscrews whilst we were riding upside down for a long time. You travel in a car of 2 rows of 2 people. It was the first ride and it was extreme to the point I was holding on very tight but had to use one had to secure my glasses which they do not suggest removing beforehand, they should though as you can see that many people have lost items whilst riding. We survied the first ride and Jack was keen to go straight on the next one.

We reserved a place on a ride called Tatsu which was the single most hair raising experience ever.
This particular ride sits you in a seat of 4 people for which you then go into to a face down position, as soon as it did this I thought to myself it would be fun. But my god no sooner had we started o climb to a ridiculous height of 265 feet ( 17 stories tall ) over what would be certain death if you fell we started going like a bat our of hell and it seemed to go forever, with similar loops and corners to scare the pants of you. This ride is quite long and goes for 3645 feet of track. You hit zero G's into a 96 foot roll and I couldn't help but close my eyes. Jack was loving this though as he is just a crazy extreme kid. We then hit what they call a pretzel roll which was just crazy. This was considered by some to be the most extreme ride but I believe not as there were rides we simply chose not to do as they were way to scary for both me and Jack.

Next was another ride called Full Trottle which was a pretty amazing ride with more loops etc but this ride you start on the inside of the loop and somehow end up on the same track but on the outside of the loop, half way though you stop and start going in reverse only to be charged to go forward again and full throttle. This was pretty fun though even though it was very very fast.
This is the fastest and tallest full loop roller coaster in the world and it deserved it's world record. 160 feet at 70 miles per hour hitting those loops again made me feel like my glasses would fall off even though I had purchased a sunglass strap to secure them to my head, I had no choice but to hold on with just one hand so as I could make sure I didn't loose my glasses, however I saw many people with glasses and hats and presumed it would be ok. Jack loved this as much as I did and so far hasn't really expressed any dislike to any and he was very keen for more.

No time to stop we went on to a newer ride called Twisted Colossus which is a wooded and metal roller coaster where two rides start off at the same time of different sides of the track within about 6 feet oe each other. This again is a world record holder where it is the longest hybrid coaster in the world, very extreme and not one for little ones of for that matter anyone that is not a little bit out of their mind. At times you hit what is called a Top Gun stall where the ride slows down at the top of a loop, crikey this was scary. Then there is what they call the Western Hemishpere High Five where the two trains pass through an overbanked turn passing each other with the feeling you could reach up and touch the other train, very close and a lot of scare factor. There were Zero G rolls 3 in a row with 360 degree rolls then a 120 foot drop at 80 degrees,the ride goes for 4 minutes and covers 5000 feet. This is one of the main park attractions and you can only do this one even with the special passes due to popularity.

We then stopped for a breather which surprisingly Jack was keen to do to, so it must have rattled him a little bit although he didn't exactly admit to it. I would do this one again if I could as it was a completely new coaster experience.

Time for some lunch which consisted of fries as a burger was $16 plus $6 for a drink, fries were only $6 which meant we would have some money left over for Jack to play some games later on.

Now it was time for the Green Lantern which was a ride we had done in the past at the Movie World in the Gold Coast. It is pretty scary due to the ride being on the die of the track and you have no visibility of any such track making you feel like you are being flipped like a pancake in the middle of nothing, it goes in every direction at very fast speeds and it wasn't the nicest ride for me but Jack wanted to do this ride back to back, so we took advantage of of special passes and just stayed in our seats to go again. I just held on tight and waited for it to finish. It rises to 150 feet and goes and a relativley slow 65 miles per hour over 400 feet of track nested into a very small area as it is intertwined with itself.

There was still lots more to do and next up was Batman. This is a special ride whose life has been extended due to popular demand, you fly backwards at 50 mph and hit 10 stories high with more loops and inverted rolls at zero G's yet again. We both loved this and did it back to back. This I think also existed at Movie World but was different in that you were backwards where in Australia it is a forward propelled ride.

Time was getting away from us and we were both feeling the effects to too much extreme action but Jacj was desperate to do Tatsu once again, this was his favorite ride and perhaps my least favorite but I did it for him as I normally end up doing. I am surely too old for these kind of rides and often find myself doing then just to support Jack. After Tatsu we played for a good while in the penny arcade and lost about $30 trying to win him an Apple Ipod. We also played a new kind of curved air hockey which was great fun, yep he beat me.

We ha finally reach our ending where it was 2:30 and we decided to check out a few shops and bought some faily floss or what they call Candy Cane for him and Lilia.

Lilia and Wendy did.........

We got picked up at 3:20pm by Wendy who was now driving the big car. Upon arrival I resumed driving as we now had to drive for an hour or so to LA and our destination was Disneyland California Resort. This was supposed to be just over an hours drive but end up taking over 3 hours due to the immense traffic . LA streets are way over crowded and I absolutely hate driving here, the traffic is 10 times worse than any Sydney traffic jams. 6 lane freeways all bottlenecked.

Eventually we got to the report but it wasn't the smoothest start as we were ushered to get all the luggage out of the car at the valet parking point where we would then hit reception to book in. Wendy had done a great job in trying to prepare the car and bags for the moment we need to return the car but we were caught unaware and didn't expect that we would need to do it immediately. I then got the run around by Disney staff who surprisingly couldn't properly direct me to where the Alamo Car Rental return station was and I end up getting told the wrong directions 3 times in a row by different people, it turned in to a 3 block walk 3 times due to wrong directions but eventually I got there, it was supposed to be just opposite the hotel.


 After checking in we went up to level 5 to check the room. From here onwards things improved dramatically as the disney resorts really do look after you and being Christmas it was a nice place to be with singers in the lobby singing carols and huge Christmas trees but it was pretty busy. Our doorman performed a little magic when he somehow made the heavy front door stay open half way, I still cannot make it happen.
