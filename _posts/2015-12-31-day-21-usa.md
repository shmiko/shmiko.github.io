## Thursday 31st 2015
I woke at 5am so as I could walk back to time square and get some early photos where there were less people, in fact there were hardly any compared to yesterday but it was still busy. I was asked by 5 different people to take their photos for them which distracted me from taking my own photos. I shot photos of Times Square and the surrounding areas and walked back to the hotel just after 7am.

It has just passed New Years Day in Sydney but for some reason New Work TV won't show more than a few seconds of footage. They focus on NY but from seeing on google we can see that it was yet again world class.

We will visit the Museum of History today and also collect our fun run packs for tonights Central Park fun run. the crowds are going to be crazy.
