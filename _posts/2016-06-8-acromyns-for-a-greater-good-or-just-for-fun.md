#### I am always making up creative new acronyms for a bit of fun but there is a serious side to using acronyms.

How many times do you walk past a colleagues desk or perhaps just down the hallway of an office space and see an acronym taking pride of place? 

They seem to be everywhere and serve as mental reminders, often as a way to motivate or a subtle way to reinforce objectives or core values. Then there are those used for a greater good, and of course acronyms that are just for fun.

I'm looking to learn the absolute best acronyms that you know and that you use on a regular basis. 
Let me start by suggesting some of my favorites for which I have recently used and that stick in my mind.

A.C.T.I.O.N - Adopting Changes to Improve Outcomes Now

T.E.A.M - Together Everyone Achieves More

S.M.A.R.T.E.R - Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant Time-Bound Evaluate Reevaluate

G.O.A.L.S - Golden Opportunities Allowing Large Successes

N.S.I - Never Stop Improving

A.S.K - Always Seek Knowledge

L.W.T - Lead Without a Title

W.T.O.H - Whatâ€™s The Opportunity Here?

W.T.F - Worse Than Failure

K.I.S.S - Keep it Simple Stupid

I am always making up creative new acronyms for a bit of fun but there is a serious side to using acronyms.

I'd love to know your favorite acronyms whether they be for fun or for a greater good.
