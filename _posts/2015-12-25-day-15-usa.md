# Merry Christmas

Christmas Day at Disneyland and we woke up very early to open pressies.
Straight to California adventure park where we qued for a fast past to cars land radiator springs race track, then to tower of terror which we all did even if Lilia and Wendy kept their eyes shut and hands clenched. We will not do that ride again. Blurr. Did the cars ride with the kids loved this.

Disneyland was at full capacity around 1pm when they started telling people to turn away as they couldn't admit any more people and when trying to move around it was just total chaos especially because every second person seems to have a mobility scooter, if not that there are so many prams. This is just the way Disneyland is and despite being so crowded everyone seems to just accept it. Nonetheless I cannot help but feel a little bit of anger because so many people seem to lack common sense and manners, there are many nice people though so they make up for the other, I guess it is similar at home just the scale of people makes it hard.


Lilia was a very lucky girl as santa had bought her a special treatment at Bibbity Boppity Boutique where she got to choose a disney character and got a new outfit, her hair, nails face all done up by a professional disney makeup artist, after she was escorted to a personal photo shoot and then onto meet 3 different Disney princesses. She looked so great. After this everyone was calling her princess which was apt because she really did look like one. Jack and I went a reserved a ride on Space Mountain but even before lunch the return time wasn't for another 7 hours which is normal for the very popular rides, the standby time was over 2 hours.
