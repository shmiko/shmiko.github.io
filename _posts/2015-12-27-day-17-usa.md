## Sunday 27th 2015

Disneyland â€“ fantasyland Snow White's Scary Adventure which is a very colorful but slow kiddy ride which Lilia wanted to do, it was still fun, this is one of few rides which has been open since 1055 when the park opened to the public for the first time. We then went to Mr Toads Wild Ride which was another slow kids ride but as usual very colorful and you can't help but enjoy them, this is also an original attraction. We then chose to do a Pinocchio Daring Journey which they call a dark ride but in fact it wasn't, it was a nice ride showing marionettes and holograms with funny mirrors. Next ride was called Storybook Land Canal Boat Ride which was a nice leisurely ride along a tiny world showing famous disney places as miniatures, there were heaps of real ducks which seemed to have made this place their permanent home, funnily we couldn't understand a single word the ride attendant said as she spoke in a funny way and too fast so it was all just gobbledygook.

 We went and got fast passes for Star Tours to return at 4pm as there was a good chance the tour this time would be different to the last as they rotate between different experiences, Alice in wonderland ride then Tom Sawyer Island for a wonder. Arranged rental car then walked to McDonalds. Back though California Adventure and cars land looking for patch, bought BB8 decoration and back to hotel for early evening. Got hotel bill and I needed to query a $70us charge for the 6 min phone call on xmas eve for which they refunded $20, but it was due to a 55% surcharge. Wendy went and got most of the 60th pennies.
