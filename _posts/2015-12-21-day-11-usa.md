## Monday 21st 2015  

![USA](/img/travel.jpg)

We left Curry Village after breakfast and was on the road by about 9am. We were going to a place called Badgers Pass which was a very popular skiing area where the has snow tubing. However when we arrived and drove in to find parking the car was slipping and it was a little daunting to think we might either get snowed in an or when trying to drive out the car would skid and slide into another car, I was actually a little worried as we were not insured for that kind of incident and I knew that if the car went sliding the only way to stop was to hit something. When we found the tubing hire area we asked the attendant for some advice about the weather conditions and driving out in deep snow and ice, he confirmed what I was worried about and he also mentioned that due to the conditions it would be a very slow day and we couldn't even start enjoying the snow fields for 90 minutes. I wasn't comfortable when weighing the risks of driving out and suggested we have a play in the snow and leave early without doing the tubing. We all agreed and played in the snow for only about 20 minutes. The snow was so nice but very soft and deep, easily 1 meter deep. After this we grabbed some hot chocolates for Wendy, Jack and Lilia and a coffee for me and hurried to get out before the snow got too deep. I drove out at about 5 miles and hour in 1st gear and it was quite scary but we made it without any dramas luckily. We figured we would drive to our accommodation at a historic township called Wawona.

We arrived at Wawona at about 1pm and Wendy went to the reception to see if we could check in early as we were all a little wet and cold. The Hotel included in the cost of the room as historic book about Yosemite and a nice little souvenir but it was amazing to get the same actual book I happened to buy last night at Yosemite, but they suggested we try to swap it for another book down at the guest shop/ store. They were happy to swap the book and we just paid the difference of $1. We were not able to check in until after 3pm so we walked around the area looking at some historic places and swapped the book over to a dedicated book about the Wawona Hotel. We then decided to have lunch in their restaurant. This was just the start of a stranger than normal hotel experience as the menu was small to say the least. Both Wendy and I were trying to split the menu pages as we could only see 1 page with 5 dishes, we honestly thought there would be a little more choice but there wasn't. The food was good and the kids had cheeseburgers from a kids menu and I forget what Wendy and I had but I remember it was good. We wondered what would be their dinner menu as there was no other choice for eating out.
After lunch we went to look at the tourist information center but it was closed for the whole season which seemed odd as there would have been about 100 people staying at just this hotel so you would think it would warrant the center to open, but this wasn't the first time. The parking was a bit of a laugh also as there was room for 12 cars still a good distance from the actual room and it was a little awkward getting the luggage to the room as it was still raining ( 3 days straight now ) but after a few trips back and forth we had settled into the room. The Wawona hotel was built in 1856 but had burnt down in the late 1800's to be rebuilt and it is a beautiful place with historic small buildings all over the property, we stayed in a building called the White Room which was 3 rooms each with a bath, in fact we were told there were only 3 rooms with a bath which was not the truth as they actually had 15 rooms but it didn't really matter but I couldn't help wondering why they said that. There was no wifi unless we walked to another building, as well there were no facilities for tea and coffee but if we reminded ourselves that we were there to sleep for the night then I guess it was pretty normal.

Late in the afternoon we decided to got to a little shop which was very close to the hotel, it may have even been owned by the hotel. We bought a 2 man snow sled for the kids to play on as the surrounding area was snow covered and it seemed like a good idea. None of us had ever tried sledding before and being a big kid myself I was pretty keen to give it a go too. We wandered just across the road and found a few small hills but it wasn't really working out as the slopes were not big enough.

We headed back to the room as it was about 4:30pm and was starting to get dark. The kids had a bath to warm themselves and we considered what we might do for dinner. None of us were keen to go to the Hotel Dining room as we had no idea if the menu would be suitable and we knew the prices would be way high as there was no other option. I went to the car and checked on the GPS for some places to eat, even though the closest place was at least 30 minutes away but since there wasn't much to do we figured it was like going for a drive. The nearest place was called Oakhurst and they had a Denny's which we all love. The manager of Denny's was very short staffed and was absolutely run of his feet so it took a while but he was very nice and later we were more than happy to give him a good tip, but you couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy. Jack had ordered Nachos, Lilia had fish n chips, Wendy had pot roast and I had a sirloin steak. All the food was great as it always is. We finished dinner and drove back to Wawona only to find that our close ( but still far ) parking space was now gone and there were cars everywhere so I dropped Wendy and the kids at the closest point and went looking for parking. I was nearly about to drive out of the hotel as there were no places to park. This is a 100+ room hotel and there was only room for like 50 cars max. I think I end up parking in there staff area, I thought it odd that I would have to park outside of the property as it was still on a highway with nowhere to park within 5 minutes walking distance.
Once back in the room we all settled in for a pretty early night, around 9:30pm and there was no point going to take photos or going for a stroll as it was raining to heavy. The room was very nice in so much that they had very high ceiling 2 big beds and a bath. This building was the managers house for many years until in 1985 they decided to change it over for guest accommodation.

 I kept waking throughout the night as I was worried about the room heaters which were right next to the beds and if during the night something happened to fall on the heater it would no doubt catch fire. Luckily I did as Lilia's jean pants accidentally ended up on them and were so hot I could tell that anytime soon we would have had a fire. Kids sleeping at about 10:30pm and I would get to sleep at about 12:30. I would normally go for a walk around the place but being so dark I chose not to.
