# Travel Problems

## ...that don't go away

- Problem Number 1.  
**Plane seat arm rests.**    
It is quite possible to board a plane and be seated in the middle of a 3 seat row, which begs the question and raises the issue of who has the right to place their arm on the arm rest. This is a problem as it is all to often a case where 1 or possibly even 2 people will take the armrest for the entire flight and therefore leaving the less forthcoming individual to stay 'armrestless' for the duration of the flight, should that be from Sydney to LA then good luck.  

- Problem Number 2.  
**Plane boarding.**   
Let paint the picture. You are traveling as a family of four, you have rows 51 and 52 which are the 2 back rows. When the time comes to board you go last? This causes so many issues it is not funny. The first 50 rows of people are all busily placing their carry on's in the overhead compartment and or perhaps sorting their onboard flight entertainment whilst standing in the walkway. So you need to struggle for 50 rows worth of people who will not make any room for people to pass. Wouldn't it be smart to let those people at the back of the plane board first so as to leave the walkway clear for those following.  

- Problem Number 3.   
**Departing the plane.**  
This is in fact opposite of the boarding issue, rows 51 & 52 should wait until all other rows have at least started to depart, this is just common sense. Whilst is is very common to see people in the later rows jump up and stand in the walkway waiting for 10 minutes before they can start to exit, meanwhile all those people who are at the closer to the exit need to wait for space to even collect their belonging, common sense should dictate that those at the rear should wait, it should be the opposite rule for boarding as stated above.  

- Problem Number 4.    
**Collecting Baggage.**  
When it comes time to collect your baggage more often or not you will see similar coordination issues around the carousel. Lets use the rows 51 and 52 scenario as an example. Lets say you have waited a good 20 minutes for rows 1 thru 50 to exit the plane, you can bet your bottom dollar that you bags will somehow be going around that carousel numerous times before you even arrive. But you will find it hard to find a place to stand as it is so crowded and directly in front of the carousel are so many children playing touchy feelies with the merry go round that it is near impossible to get to your bags, so you just watch them go around again. It is yet again a lacking of common sense that governs how the bags are loaded and unloaded. One would think that if the airline coordinated the luggage in accordance to row numbers and applied some logic to boarding and exiting the plane that the carousel area would be far less impacted and could in fact operate quite smoothly. People could actually plan and allocate the time requited to best determine when to arrive at the carousel thus allowing room for those watching their bags travel around from afar.

- Problem Number 5.  
**Bag Weight Limits.**  
Wouldn't it be nice if all airlines made it obvious before lining up to check you bags in the actual weight allowances. How many times do we get caught out because we have a multi airline trip and trying to remember that going from an international flight to a domestic US flight ( as an example ) means redistributing packs bags so as to reduce the weight, this might even mean purchasing new bags to fit the excess weight into and suffering the cost. But what makes this situation far less ideal is that you often don't know what the weight limits are on an interconnecting flight and only find out when they start weighing the bags which means an obvious inconvenience to yourself and all those people waiting behind you for the ordeal of repacking right there and then. There must be a way to alert consumers of the upcoming change in weight restrictions before that disturbing moment arrives.

- Problem Number 6.  
**Over allocating Airline Seats.**  
I'm sure we have all been in the situation where we plan to travel in the off season to reduce inflight overcrowding in the hope you will get a full row of seats to yourself, but it's more common to see that the airline has discounted tickets so drastically that you will be in the position where the off season now appears to be peak season. The announcement comes onto the flight board near the gate that asks for people will to delay their travel plans can do so and get the advantage of a $$$ discount of their next purchase and free food whilst they incur and extended delay waiting for the next flight.
Wouldn't it make sense to have the sellers of the seats be hooked into the actual allocation database so that they could foresee if seats were actually available, how it is possible defies belief. This can surely be addressed in a very easy and cost effective manner.

- Problem Number 7.  
**Huge lines to check in?**  
A little known fact is that many airlines now have bag check-in facilities just off the street outside of the airport, they do not advertise this and it is only known to those that have somehow happened across the information. Wouldn't it be in the best interest for everyone involved at the airport to know of such rules. The mere fact that you can save upwards of an hour by standing at the street level check in can save a huge amount of stress. There is nothing worse that being on the later side of check in that you see a line 100 deep and know that you have at least another hour to go because there happens to be lines for the next two flights after yours. Sure a little bit of preparation on the consumers part might help but it's a fact that people will run late and the less congestion the better. Solution, maybe open up street level check in for late arrivals where you plane is departing within 30 minutes.

- Problem Number 8.  
**Leaving the airport after security checks.**  
Going outside for any reason after having been through airport security. Why is this a problem? Well quite often you leave you bags with you party of fellow travelers who have secured seating at the gate or perhaps in a lounge area, what happens next might seem unlikely but it does happen. You might go outside for a smoke for example and leave your passport in your bag and just take you boarding pass. It will only cause you to either miss your plane or leave you with very little time to work your way through the complex security check to make it. Just having a boarding pass won't cut it despite that you have already cleared security checkpoints earlier. this may sound silly as in why would you not take your passport. But why should you need it, as long as you have some identification the system should know that you were there earlier and shouldn't need to see your passport or boarding pass for that matter. With all the capabilities of electronic information available the airport security checkpoints remain one of the most laborious tasks around proving who you are and that you are entitled to be there. Sure checking for dangerous items is a must and that should happen regardless but the idea of proof of identity and passport legitimacy is a no brainer.

- Problem Number 9.  
**Inflight Entertainment.**  
How can it be that so often the Inflight system either costs extreme prices or for some reason doesn't work. yet again with the availability of digital information this information should be readily available when either booking or checking in at the vey least so as you can make some alternative arrangements. if the back of seat screen isn't working or the remote to control the working screen is broken then you should be alerted as such, similarly if the price of watching anything is so prohibitive that it make your discount flight like traveling first class then you should also be made aware of such things. Unfortunately this is not the case and it is left until the time you try to operate the system that it become apparent of the misgivings. In this day and age the relaying of such information should be taken for granted.

- Problem Number 10.  
**Leaving the Airport.**  
For most international long haul flights each person is allowed 2 bags and 1 carry-on plus a handbag or laptop bag. this in total for 4 people consists of 16 potential luggage components. the problem arises when you try to get transport to not only accommodate 4 people but all 16 luggage items. Needless to say that some prior warning that you should have stayed in LA as Las vegas doesn't cater to such a request seems ludicrous. But this is a reality. You either book for a luxury limousine to take you to a motel 9 or need to split you traveling group up or split you luggage and likely still have to wait an additional hour so as someone can call someone who needs to call someone just to make this special arrangement. So if you happen to be on a family vacation in the US for 6 weeks and know you will need transport you are likely going to be out of luck. I'm sure we can do better with the wealth of available information on the superhighway of knowledge.
