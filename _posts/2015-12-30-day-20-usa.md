## Wednesday 30th 2015  


Out the door by 9 to a subway downtown to see City Hall, court house and a walk on Brooklyn bridge, China town and Little Italy then back up town to American Girl and Lego store, no purchases just browsing, the along 5th avenue, Streets are very very busy. Back to hotel for a couple of hours downtime then we went for some dinner at about 4:30pm. We went to Wendy's which has nice cheap food. We then went for a walk down to Times Square it was so chaotic due to the crowds which were like nothing we had ever seen, well apart from Disneyland I guess. I have sent an email to Elaine Goddard who is a mates wife from Sydney who I used to work with many years ago but still keep in touch with as we have planned to meet up tomorrow, we are all doing the central park fun run for NYE. Ordered a late night Pizza as the earlier meal obviously wasn't enough. The NY pizza's are always so good and huge too, just like all supersize US food and drinks.
