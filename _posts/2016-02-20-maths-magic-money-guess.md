## Mathematics Tricks


1. How to guess **how much money** someone has in their wallet/purse or pocket.


**1.** How to guess **how much money** someone has on them. Just guessing either dollars only or cents only.
STEPS - Ask person to do these steps
   1.       Ask them to take the amount he they in his pocket or wallet/purse, count it and remember the number.
   2.       Ask them to add 5 to the number.
   3.       Ask them to multiply by 5 the answer from step 2 .
   4.       Ask them to to double the answer from step 3.
   5.       Ask them to add any one digit number from 0 to 9 to the result from step 4.
   6.       Ask them to add 10 to the result from step 5.
   After the steps are over ask them to tell you the final answer.

ADDITIONAL STEPS - To be done by you
    ·      Ignore the digit in the unit’s place from the answer given.
    ·      From the remaining number, subtract 6 and you will come to know the amount of money they have.

EXAMPLE
Let us suppose a person has $23 on them. The steps are given below:
    1.      Take the amount in your wallet        = 23
    2.      Add 5                                 = 28
    3.      Multiply by 5                         = 140
    4.      Double the answer                     = 280
    5.      Add a single digit number (say, 7)    = 287
    6.      Add 10                                = 297

The final answer would have been 297.
Ignore the digit in the unit’s place (in this case it is 7). Now the remaining number is 29.
From 29, we subtract 6 to get 23.
The our answer is **$23**.

Another quick EXAMPLE
Assume money is $48
48 + 5 = 53 X 5 = 265 X 2 = 530 + 3 = 533 + 10 = 543, remove 3 = 54 - 6 = **48**!
