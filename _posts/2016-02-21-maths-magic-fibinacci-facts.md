**1.** **Fibonacci** Fun Facts and **The Golden Ratio**

Fibonacci numbers are those where the following number in a sequence is added to the previous number to get the next number usually read using the following mathematical formula.  
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2  

EXAMPLE  
1 1 2 3 5 8 13  21  34  55  89  

1 + 1 + 4 = 6 which = 2 X 3  
1 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 15 which + 3 X 5  
1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 = 40 which = 5 X 8  
1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 64 = 104 which = 8 X 13 which is 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 = 8 X 13  

These sequences can be represented as a box of squares/rectanlges  
Once drawn as boxes you can get the area using the same as above 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 = 8 X 13  
or height X length, 13 = 8 + 5  

Another way to look at the same sequence  
8 X 13  = 13 / 8  = 1.625  
13 X 21 = 21 / 13 = 1.615  
21 X 34 = 34 / 21 = 1.619  
34 X 55 = 55 / 34 = 1.6176  
55 X 89 = 89 / 55 = 1.61818  

This is showing the **Golden Ration** known as 1.618033
