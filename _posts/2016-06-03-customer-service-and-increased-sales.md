#### Customer Service to Increased Sales 

![Customer Service](/img/customer-service.jpg "Customer Service") 

**Know your customer and understand the market**  
Take the time to really get to know your customer well. Fully understand the market so you can capitalise and maximise on every sales opportunity. Understanding the market will allow you to react to market changes and to consider competition so as to precisely target the customers needs. Most importantly the customer will feel important and this will lead the customer to justify the purchase they may be considering. 
Trader Joe's are a company who do this extremely well by using social media to understand everything about their customers.  

**Know your product inside out and show your passion for the product**
Thorough product knowledge shows passion and commitment, it will give the customer a good feeling about their purchase and ease the decision-making process. Knowledge will also instill confidence in sales teams and drive opportunity for cross-selling and/or up-selling. All staff should have equal opportunities for product knowledge training increasing their awareness of product functions and capability, this will ultimately benefit the company they represent. Remember product features and benefits. 
Apple is well-known for having staff passionate and very knowledgeable about Apple products and they remain a very customer-centric organisation.  

**Don't try to sell the customer, persuade the customer to buy**
Change the way you view the sales process. Stop the inclination to hard sell and try to adopt a process where the customer is persuaded to make their own purchase decision. This empowers the customer and will put them in control and result in an increase in word of mouth referrals, which is one of the best ways to increase sales opportunities. Go out of your way to offer something extra, not necessarily related to the product, and show that you are there for the customer to make their experience as easy as possible and memorable.  
Amazon enables this due to having a vast selection of products making it very easy to purchase from a one-stop shopping experience.  

**Be sincere, don't offer something that is not in their best interest**
Only offer something which will be beneficial to the customer. If you can get past the idea of just making a sale enabling reaching your target or quota, the experience will be far more fulfilling and offer greater rewards personally and for the customer. Ask yourself if what you are offering is actually something you would want to be sold or buy. Offer opt-in extras and refrain from forcing a customer to opt-out, make this a customer decision and not a business decision.   
Zappos operate this way and they take their customer service offering very seriously and you have 365 days to consider returning your product for a full refund.  

**Be mindful and show empathy**
Don't lose sight of where the customer is coming from and their mindset. Be aware of what you can do to make this moment a positive experience based on the customers needs and their current situation. Customers will feel important and return the favor by purchasing more often and likely become a recommender of your product or service and potentially leaving endorsements which will generate more sales.   
Nordstromâ€™s are a retailer known for their customer focus through having very caring staff who cater to the customer experience with sincere dedication.  

**The customer is usually always right**
You should use extreme caution when considering a rebuttal which can be construed as argumentative. Rephrase the message in a non-threatening way whilst remaining in control of the situation. Circumvent any potential negativity and more importantly, a possible loss of sales which is likely to result from an unhappy customer. Take full advantage of every unhappy customer, use this moment as an opportunity to make them happy and win them back, you will gain greater respect and likely have a repeat customer for life.  
Walmart is an excellent company and a great example of how well they manage this kind of situation.  

**Follow through, reach out to understand the sales experience**
The transaction is not the final component of a successful sales process. Follow up with the customer and find out their thoughts on the product and the experience. Show the customer that you value their opinion by getting their feedback on what can be done differently to improve their experience.  
Southwest Airlines are renown for this service capability and are known for the excellent customer service capability stemming from the very top of their organisation.
