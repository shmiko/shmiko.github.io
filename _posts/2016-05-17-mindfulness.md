#### Mindfulness 8 Week MBSR Online Course 

Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction - Working towards a better me. 

I'm starting another self improvement process which is all about mindfulness.  

Although I have been aware of trying to be mindful and more aware I have doubts that I actually achieve anything as my mind is wandering a world of it's own.  

I have been a big follower of Jon Kabat-Zinn for some years now and have watched many a video tutorial of Johns as well as having read his book [Wherever You Go, There You Are](http://www.amazon.com/Wherever-You-Go-There-Are/dp/1401307787) back in the early 2000's.  

Despite that being mindful is a life long journey and needs conscience practice everyday, for which I fail to do. I'd like to blame the fact that I work 60-70 hours per week and study for 50 hours per week which leaves me just enough time to see my family and walk the dog once a week. 

But I suspect this is a feeble excuse as It is up to me to control my own destiny and prioritise accordingly those things that will have the most benefit and maximise return to make me a better person.  

So I have committed to stick with this 8 week program and see what changes I can make happen for the better of not just me but those around me.  

I'd like to become a better leader and initiate change to my workplace as I believe there is much to do about plenty.
