## Software Developments Methodologies!  

So what's all the HooHa about Software Development Methodologies, lets see what the differences are bwtween the majors.    


**We have....**     
* Waterfall   
* Agile   
* Scrum  
* Extreme  
* Lean  
* Kanban  
* Personal Kanban   
* Kaizen  
* Tools  

These methodologies are taught through numerous courses, but most notable are 1.Lean Software Development Fundamantals taught by Stephen Haunts from Puralsight and also Software Project Management Specialisation taught by University of Alberta through Coursera both of which I absolutley recommend.  
[Lean Software Development Fundamantals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/lean-software-development-fundamentals/table-of-contents) Lean Software Development Fundamantals  
and [Software Project Management Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management) Software Project Management Specialisation

**Starting with....**   
* Waterfall  
	Is a sequential design process first presented by Herbert Benington in 1956, originally used in manufacturing and construction. At this time no other methodologies existed and as such this method was adapted for software development.  
It is based on the following phases:  
1. Conception  
	2. Initiation  
		3. Analysis  
			4. Design  
				5. Construction  
					6. Testing  
						7. Implementation  
							8. Maintenance  
The waterfall analogy is due to the fact that each phase flows steadily downwards.  
In 1985 is was further refined by Royce to have just 6 phases whilst still incorperating the original list.
The waterfall model maintains that the next phase should only be started once the preceding phase has been completed, reviewed and verified.  

**Next Up....**   
* Agile   
* Scrum  
* Extreme  
* Lean  
* Kanban  
* Personal Kanban   
* Kaizen  
* Tools
