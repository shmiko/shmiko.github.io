These methodologies are taught through numerous courses, but most notable are 1.Lean Software Development Fundamantals taught by Stephen Haunts from Puralsight and also Software Project Management Specialisation taught by University of Alberta through Coursera both of which I absolutley recommend.  
[Lean Software Development Fundamantals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/lean-software-development-fundamentals/table-of-contents)  
and [Software Project Management Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management)  
<a id="Waterfall"></a>  
**Starting with....**   

**Waterfall**  

#### A linear sequential design process first presented by Herbert Benington in 1956, originally used in manufacturing and construction. At this time no other methodologies existed and as such this method was adapted for software development.  
 
It is a Linear Process Model based on the following phases:  

Waterfall Layout: 
![Waterfall](/img/waterfall.png "Waterfall")

The waterfall analogy is due to the fact that each phase flows steadily downwards.  
In 1985 is was further refined by Royce to have just 6 phases whilst still incorperating the original list.

The waterfall model maintains that the next phase should only be started once the preceding phase has been completed, reviewed and verified.

**V-Model**  

#### Whilst still a linear process there is a small improvement over the Waterfall model  as it allows for more client involvement.
 
The V-Model was created in response to the limitations of the Waterfall model however this process is still strict and can be costly to incorperate changes.  
The V-Model beginds with the left sided Analysis and Requirements phase and end with the right sided acceptance testing phase.
The phases on the right side validate the left sided phases.
V-Model Layout:

<a id="Sawtooth"></a>  

The V-Model is still a consectutive process but does allow for product verification at multiple levels.  <h6>[Top](#top)</h6>

**Sawtooth**  

#### The Sawtooth model is also a linear model process but was introduced to addresss the lack of client involvement in Waterfall and V-Model processes.  
 
Sawtooth Layout: 
![Sawtooth](/img/sawtooth.png "Sawtooth")

As with Waterfall and the V-Model there is limited scope for change and as a sequential process if there is any change incorperated then all initial processes must be repeated which results ina costly and time consuming process.

**Agile** aka The Agile Manifesto.  

#### Agile is a method of development is based on principles which require collaboration between self-organising, cross-functional teams where by requirements and solutions evolve gradually through adaptive planning, evolutionary development and continual improvement, encouraging rapid and flexible responseive changes to feedback.  

Originally conceived in the 1980s, the manifesto was initiated in 1994 and finally proposed in 2001. 

The Agile Manifesto is based on 12 principles:  
1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software  
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development  
3. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)  
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers  
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted  
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)  
7. Working software is the principal measure of progress  
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace  
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design  
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential  
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams  
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

<a id="Scrum"></a>

**Scrum** is a iterative and incremental framework used for managing software development projects.  It is a flexible and holistic strategy where a team works towards a common goal.  

#### First described in 1986 in Japan by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka who suggested that this method would increase speed and flexibility for commercial product development.  

A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, 
the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements volatility[4]), 
and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem 
cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.  
The workflow of Scrum includes Planning, Daily Scrum, Review and Retrospective and Extensions.  
From a more software focus the term Scrumban is used as it is more suited to software development and projects with frequent and unexpected work items or progrmming errors.

<a id="Extreme"></a>

**Extreme programming** (XP) 

#### intended to improve the quality of software and the responsiveness to changes for customer requirements. 

It is a type of agile process advocating frequent sprint cycles intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints whereby new requirements can be adopted.  

Programming pairing, code review and unit testing are other elements of extreme programming. 
Created in 1996 by Kent Beck.  

XP was introduced due to the high discipline required by the original practices often went by the wayside, causing some of these practices, such as those thought too rigid, to be deprecated or reduced, or even left unfinished, on individual sites.  
Extreme Programming Explained describes extreme programming as a software-development discipline that organizes people to produce higher-quality software more productively.  
Extreme programming also introduces a number of basic values, principles and practices on top of the agile programming framework.  
Activities - Coding, Testing, Listening, Designing.  
Values - Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect.  
Rules  
Principles - Feedback, Assumed Simplicity, Embracing Change.  

XP attempts to reduce the cost of changes in requirements by having multiple short development cycles, rather than a long one. In this doctrine, changes are a natural, inescapable and desirable aspect of software-development projects, and should be planned for, instead of attempting to define a stable set of requirements.

**Lean Software Development** (LSD) 

#### Based on Lean Manufacturing and Lean IT principles and practices in the software development domain.  

It was adapted from the famous production system as introduced by Toyota manufacturing in 1998 kown as Kanban. (see below)  

It is based on 7 principles as proposed by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck (2003) in their book titled [Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&pg=PA182&redir_esc=y)   
1. Eliminate waste  
2. Amplify learning  
3. Decide as late as possible  
4. Deliver as fast as possible  
5. Empower the team  
6. Build integrity in  
7. See the whole

**Kanban**    

#### It is aligned with Agile software development, it is a method for managing work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery.  

Developed by Toyota in the 1960s it is a visual process managaement system. Kanban helps company's to control the logistics chain being a pull flow system based on sales requirements.
It is based on 6 core priciples.  
1. Visualise - most common is to use a board with cards and columns. Each column represents the different state or step in the workflow.
2. Limit “Work In Progress” issues
3. Manage flow - the flow of work in the workflow should be monitored, measured and reported.
4. Stabilization and rationalization process
5. Anything that does not contribute to value creation for the customer, should be removed
6. Exact adjustment of production levels

**Personal Kanban**   
  

#### Originally conceived by Jim Benson. Personal kanban tracks and visualises items of personal value - tasks, work and goals.  

In contrast to industry style kanban as described above which tracks industrial objects of value as they travel through a production stream, personal kanban tracks items of person value they travel thru a less predictable path. 
Personal Kanban is a great tool to visualize your work, to limit your WIP and to take better control of your life, either alone or together with your significant other, your kids or even your team at the office.
Making use of a Kanban Board is a common way to visualise kanban and being split into 4 columns each having a distinct function it allows for some consise measurement of work in progress, backlog work and work that has been done.
These 3 columns are referred to as a 'Value Stream', which is the flow of work from the moment you start it to the moment you finish it. This is often written onto a white board where tasks can be migrated from 1 column rto another as tasks are tracked.  
It is based on iteration of tasks or Prioritising, Refining and Reducing.

**5s**    

#### A Japanese philosophy yet again based on similar core principles as Lean and Kanban and is essentially the same as JIT or Just-In-Time production.  

It is a set of steps that streamline work processes, eliminating waste and inefficiencies and helping to reduce variation in processes.  
By combining these 5 principles with your personal kanban will allow you to reap more benefits. 
The Japanese terms are seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, and shitsuke and when romanised all start with the letter 'S'.  
Transalted they are They can be translated from the Japanese as "sort", "set in order", "shine", "standardize", and "sustain".  

*Sort* refers to: 
Removing junk and disposing of unnecessary items.  
Eliminating obstacles.  
Prevent accumulation of unnecessary items.  
Evaluate necessary items with regard to cost.  
Remove all parts or tools not in use. 
Segregate unwanted materials from the workplace.  
Waste Removal.  

*Set* refers to:  
Arrange all required items for easy selection.  
Prevent loss and waste by arranging workstations in such a way that all tooling is in close proximity.  
Make it easy to find and pick up items.  
Ensure FCFS ( first-come-first-served ) basis.  
Make workflow smooth and easy.  

*Shine* refers to:  
Clean your workplace completely.  
Use cleaning as inspection.  
Prevent machinery and equipment deterioration.  
Keep workplace safe and easy to work in.  
Keep workplace clean and nice to work in.  

*Standardise* refers to:  
Standardise the best practices in the work area.  
Maintain high standards and workplace organisation at all times.  
Maintain orderliness.  
Maintain everything in order and according to its standard.  
Everything in its right place.  
Every process has a standard.  

*Sustain* refers to:  
To keep in proper working order.  
Also translates as "do without being told".  
Perform regular audits.  
Training and Discipline.

**Kaizen** (Continuous Improvement) 

#### A strategy where employees at all levels of a company work together proactively to achieve regular, incremental improvements to the manufacturing process. In a sense, it combines the collective talents within a company to create a powerful engine for improvement.  

Kaizen actually means 'Improvement' or 'Change for Better' in Sino-Japanese.  
It is a daily process which goes beyond simple productivity improvemnet. It is a process that when done properly humanises the workplace  
and eliminates overly hark work, it also teaches people how to perform experiments of their work using scientific methods and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in a business process.
Kaizen is closely associatted with Toyota. In short it is a continual improvement process and involves all employees, it can be applied to all processes such as purchasing, logistics that cross organisational boundaries into the supply chain.  
The cycle of Kaizen can be defined as 'Plan, Do, Check, Act' or 'PDCA'. This acronym can also be labeled as 'Problem Finding, Disply, Clear, Acknowledge'.  
Often used in conjunction with Kaizen is the technique known as the '5 Whys' which questions the user about a failure that may have occurred where each subsequent question is based on the previous one.

**Six Sigma**    

#### A set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It was introduced by engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986.  

Six Sigma seeks to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes.  
It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization, who are experts in these methods.  
A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects (3.4 defective features per million opportunities).

**Kaikaku** (Japanese for "radical change")  

#### Abusiness concept concerned with making fundamental and radical changes to a production system, unlike Kaizen which is focused on incremental minor changes.  

Both Kaizen and Kaikaku can be applied to activities other than production.
Kaikaku and Kaizen are concepts in Japanese production philosophy that relate to each other. Both have origins in the Toyota Production System.

Kaikaku means a radical change, during a limited time, of a production system.  
Kaizen, on the other hand, is continuous minor changes of a certain area of a production system, often with the primary goal of solving team related problems.  
Kaizen is based on all employees involvement and individual activities generally reach an improvement of less than 20%.  
A cross between Kaikaku and Kaizen is Kaizen Blitz (or Kaizen Events), which implies a radical improvement in a limited area, such as a production cell, during an intense week.  
Kaikaku projects can be of four different types:[1]

Locally innovative - Capital intensive
eg. an installation of robot automation in a factory is not new to the industry in general, but may be new to the company. The decision is strategically grounded and could mean higher costs
Locally innovative - Operation close
eg. the introduction of conventional methods Six Sigma or TPM may be new to the company. The direct cost is relatively small
Radically innovative - Capital intensive
eg. the introduction of a new and innovative production technology
Radically innovative - Operation close
eg. the introduction of new and innovative production solutions that are new to the industry

**Tools** to help:  

**Trello** 

#### A web-based project management application originally made by Fog Creek Software in 2011, that spun out to be its own company in 2014.  

Trello uses the kanban paradigm for managing projects, originally popularized by Toyota in the 1980s for supply chain management.  

Projects are represented by boards, which contain lists (corresponding to task lists). Lists contain cards (corresponding to tasks).  
Cards are supposed to progress from one list to the next (via drag-and-drop), for instance mirroring the flow of a feature from idea to implementation.  
Users can be assigned to cards. 
Users and boards can be grouped into organisations.

**KanbanFlow** 

#### A Lean project management tool for you and your team.  

Visualize your work

The Kanban board gives you an excellent overview of your current work situation.
When working in a team of people you can instantly see what other people are working on right now, what has been done and what is coming up. 
It's intuitive user interface will get you up and running in a few minutes.  
You can optionally track the time you are working on a task by using a timer.  
The timer supports the popular Pomodoro technique for time management.  
The Pomodoro technique recommends working with full focus for 25 minutes before taking a short break.  
Then work another 25 minutes followed by another break. And so on.
