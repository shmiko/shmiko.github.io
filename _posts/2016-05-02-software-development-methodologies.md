## Software Developments Methodologies!  

So what's all the HooHa about Software Development Methodologies, lets see what the differences are bwtween the majors.    


**We have....**     
* Waterfall   
* Agile   
* Scrum  
* Extreme  
* Lean  
* Kanban  
* Personal Kanban   
* Kaizen  
* Tools  

These methodologies are taught through numerous courses, but most notable are 1.Lean Software Development Fundamantals taught by Stephen Haunts from Puralsight and also Software Project Management Specialisation taught by University of Alberta through Coursera both of which I absolutley recommend.

and [Software Project Management Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management) Software Project Management Specialisation

**Starting with....**   
* Waterfall  
Which is a sequential design process first presented by Herbert Benington in 1956, originally used in manufacturing and construction. At this time no other methodologies existed and as such this method was adapted for software development.  
It is based on the following phases:  
1. Conception  
	2. Initiation  
		3. Analysis  
			4. Design  
				5. Construction  
					6. Testing  
						7. Implementation  
							8. Maintenance  
The waterfall analogy is due to the fact that each phase flows steadily downwards.  
In 1985 is was further refined by Royce to have just 6 phases whilst still incorperating the original list.
The waterfall model maintains that the next phase should only be started once the preceding phase has been completed, reviewed and verified.  

**Next Up....**   
* Agile aka The Agile Manifesto.  
This is very common in the age of continual improvement, especially with start-ups and their MVP's having a high iteration rate.  
This method of development is based on principles which require collaboration between self-organising, cross-functional teams where by requirements and solutions evolve gradually through adaptive planning, evolutionary development and continual improvement, encouraging rapid and flexible responseive changes to feedback.  
Originally conceived in the 1980s, the manifesto was initiated in 1994 and finally proposed in 2001. 

The Agile Manifesto is based on 12 principles:  
1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software  
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development  
3. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)  
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers  
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted  
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)  
7. Working software is the principal measure of progress  
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace  
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design  
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential  
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams  
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

**And now....**  
* Scrum is a iterative and incremental framework used for managing software development projects.  It is a flexible and holistic strategy where a team works towards a common goal.  
First described in 1986 in Japan by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka suggesting that this method would increase speed and flexibility for commercial product development.

**Then there was....**  
* Extreme programming (XP) was intended to improve the quality of software and the responsiveness to changes for customer requirements. It is a type of agile process advocating frequent sprint cycles intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints whereby new requirements can be adopted.  
Programming pairing, code review and unit testing are other elements of extreme programming. 
Created in 1996 by Kent Beck.  

**As well as....** 
* Lean Software Development (LSD) is based on Lean Manufacturing and Lean IT principles and practices in the software development domain.  
It was adapted from the famous production system as introduced by Toyota manufacturing in 1998.  

It is based on 7 principles as proposed by Mary Poppendieck; Tom Poppendieck (2003) in their book titled [Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit] (https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&pg=PA182&redir_esc=y) Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit.
1. Eliminate waste  
2. Amplify learning  
3. Decide as late as possible  
4. Deliver as fast as possible  
5. Empower the team  
6. Build integrity in  
7. See the whole  

**And....**   
* Kanban  
* Personal Kanban   
* Kaizen  
* Tools
