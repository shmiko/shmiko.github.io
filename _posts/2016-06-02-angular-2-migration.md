#### AngularJS Migration to version 2.0 

Angular 2 is amost here, well it is here in theory but not quite production ready.  
Despite this it is near enough to production ready that we need to start seriousley considering the migration path for Angular 1 based Applications.  

Is a complete rewrite the correct approach or it is better to slowly transition to Angular 2?

We need to be mindful of minimising risk and enabling migration whilst maintaining application written in Angular 1.  

First up you will need to prepare code following a style guide - see John Pappa's Angular Style Guide here. [Angular 2 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a2/README.md)  

Next you will need to understand and be prepared for Typescript and ES6, and whilst this is not mandatory it is highly recommended as they will add significant benfit to the ongoing success of next generation Angular apps.  

Finally understanding how to incorperate Angular 2 to current Angular 1 codebase will enable a staged migration path, knowing what to migrate and knowing how to migrate services and components.
