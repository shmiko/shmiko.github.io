## Sunday 10th 2016  

We will head to Kanab. Arrived bout 12 noon to find most everything shut due to it being Sunday and a very small country town. On our trip here we had a few stops, one being at a buffalo ranch which was very pretty and had a very “cute” indian statue out front. Light snow fall in Kanab upon arrival. Staying at Crazy Horse RV park due to location. Did washing and catch up on stuff. Ready for an early start tomorrow in the hope to gain wave permits. Lilia and I went for a walk and muddied our new shoes by stepping in very soft sticky mud about 6 inches deep, on the way back we tried to clean them by stepping in snow, not once but 5 times as the mud was so thick. We went via 7-11 and found some nice things to but but decided to wait for Wendy before we bought them as there may have been other things she wanted. We went back for Wendy and Jack but first bought Wendy a little dream catcher. Afterwards we end up buying a cool sling shot and some ammo as well a Star Wars magazine. We then went for dinner at Wendy's for some burgers.
