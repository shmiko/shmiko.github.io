#### Body Language Skills you just have to learn.  

I recently sat through 2 courses taught by none other that the amazing Vanessa Van Edwards who is the principle behavioral investigator at [scienceofpeople.org](scienceofpeople.org). 

I have since signed up for 2 more of her courses and can't wait to sit them.   

Not only is Vanessa simply and amazing person she has an awesome approach to teaching and has had a massive impact on what I took away for the courses. 
In addition to being a great teacher Vanessa is highly sought after for her public [speaking](http://www.scienceofpeople.com/speaking/) and has a uncanny ability to enthraul audiences world wide.   

She teaches 6 courses at Udemy, 5 of which are paid courses and 1 of those being a new course offered in just the last few weeks.  

The course listing is:

1. [Body Language for Entrepreneurs](https://www.udemy.com/body-language-for-entrepreneurs/)  
2. [The Secrets of Body Language](https://www.udemy.com/the-secrets-of-body-language-webinar/)  
3. [How to be a Human Lie Detector](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-be-a-human-lie-detector/)  
4. [7 Scientifically Proven Steps to Increase Your Influence](https://www.udemy.com/7-scientifically-proven-steps-to-increase-your-influence/)  [Free]  
5. [Supercharge Your Sales with Body Language](https://www.udemy.com/supercharge-your-sales-with-body-language/)  
6. [Body Language of Love and Dating](https://www.udemy.com/body-language-of-love-and-dating/)  

Vanessa also holds personal [courses](http://www.scienceofpeople.com/work-with-me/) through her website which you should seriously check out.

At scienceofpeople the content is second to none and will keep you entertained as well as learning somehting new for hours on end.  

I have spent lot of time on the site and having covered most all of the content I seriousley recommend it, and the content is always being added to.  

If you get serious about studying what Vanessa teaches you can progress even further by taking an instructors course again through scienceofpeople.com which is held just once or twice per year at certain times, but be warned these courses are hugely popular and when registration opens they fill up almost instantly.  

In saying that I am going to try my luck for placement in the upcoming June intake.  

See here for more information... [Trainer](http://www.scienceofpeople.com/trainer/)
Applications will be open from June 9th, 2016 to June 17th, 2016. 

I cannot speak highly enough of Vanessa and her down to earth approach, I feel privileged to have learnt so much from her.

A great sign of  a great course is when the student walks away and is talking about it to other associates, and in doing so they are actually passing on knowledge from the course in a way to emphasize the lessons learn't, well I have been doing just this and whether or not it has been a conscience thing I don't know but I have been finding opportunities to bring up many topics that I learnt recently. Speaking about them enforces what I learnt and enables me to put into practice those same lessons.  

Thanks Vanessa Van Edwards - you are a truly amazing.
