Up early again and this time we caught the monorail into to the Disney park, we went to straight to the Matterhorn which does not allow a fast pass, lucky for us the wait was just 5 minutes due to us being there for the early hours which hotel guests get, shortly after the Matterhorn we went to Nemo's Submarine Adventure which was a remake of 70000 leagues under the sea from when we went in 1980. The kids had a go on some race cars and then we went to It's a Small World which has been done up in a christmas theme, it was terrific. Not one ride in Fantasyland allows fast passes which seems strange as it is mainly for young one who are less likely to want to wait for hours on end to take a ride, but this is the only way to do them. We grabbed some Starbucks and headed of to see a Star Wars exhibition with props from the movies and also was very lucky to get personal photos with Chewbacca. After seeing all the exhibits we left the park? Saw the Christmas parade at 1pm, had lunch at a very posh restaurant Cathary Circle where I could not even pronounce half the menu but it was absolutely beautiful, well my dish or duck was, Wendy had chicken skewers, Jack had a burger and Lilia had Soba noodles, eating at this resturant allowed us to gain a reserver standing spot for World of colour light show. Later in the night I went back to the Star Wars Shop in Disneyland and bought for the family another BB-8 Droid Toy, this is the App enabled
