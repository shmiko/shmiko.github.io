**First Day In America**

## 10 December 2015

We arrived at about 6:30am US time, it then took an hour to get to the hotel.

We went shopping to see a special shop for Lilia and Wendy (mostly Lilia) called American Girl.   
Lilia saved all of her money for this shop so she was in heaven.

Tonight we see the world premiere of Curiosity by Cirque Du Soleil at the Dodge Stadium, 8pm to 10pm, this will be one heck of a show.  

We have all been awake since leaving Australia so we are all so very tired but we'll be right after a good night sleep.

Ok we'll post some photos we took today soon also.

Take care
