## Mathematics Vectors and Points


1. A point is a location in space represented by coordinates in space or the location.  
Written as (x,y) in a 2D environment or as (x,y,z) in a 3D environment.      
Example (2,-1) represented visually on an x,y grid. x is first.  

2. A vector is an object representing a change in space. Magnitude and direction written as
[x  
 y  
 x]. This as an example when referenced via a grid showing movement of the points would be written as  
 [  
  2  
  4] indicating a movement of 2 points in the x direction and 4 points of movement in the y direction.  

** Operations on Vectors  

 - Addition using python - use __str function to print coordinates
 my_vector = ([0,1] + [1,2])  
 print my_vector gives (1,3)

this grid above should represent the points 1,1 and 2,2 as a vector this is [1,1] + [2,2]  

** Subtraction  

([1,3] - [5,1]) = [-4,2]  

** Scalar Multiplication  

(2*[1,2]) = [2,4]  
(-1/2[3,2,1]) = [-3/2,-1,-1/2]  


Examples:  
([8.218,-9.341] + [-1.129,2.111]) = [7.089,-7.230]  
([7.119,8.215] - [-8.223,0.878]) = [15.342,7.337]  
(7.41[1.671,-1.012,-0.318]) = [12.382,-7.499,-2.356]
