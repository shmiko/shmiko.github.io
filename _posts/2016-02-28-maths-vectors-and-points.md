## Mathematics Vectors and Points


1. A point is a location in space represented by co ordinates in space or the location.  
Written as (x,y) in a 2D environment or as (x,y,z) in a 3D environment.      
Example (2,-1) represented visually on an x,y grid. x is first.  

2. A vector is an object representing a change in space. Magnitude and direction written as
[x  
 y  
 x]. This as an example when referenced via a grid showing movement of the points would be written as  
 [  
  2  
  4] indicating a movement of 2 points in the x direction and 4 points of movement in the y direction.
