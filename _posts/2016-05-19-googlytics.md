#### Googlytics 

Google Analytics - Working towards another certification. 

I'm going to write up the steps I am taking tp compete another certification, well this will be geared towards 2 certs. 

One for Google Analytics and the other for Google Adwords.

My reason for learning both are that the Adwords is a well need marketing skill for any online business and having starting my own online startup over 12 months ago I need to start thinking about maximising what SEO potential there is.  
As for Google Analytics well if Adwords are in play I need to know about how effective they are, Analytics to the rescue. Not just for my startup but I'm interested to see what activity all of my various domains are getting.  

I have 7 active sites across 3 domains and as such I am very curious if they attract anyone at all, I suspect not as they were put online for my benefit and as such i never antisipated have an audience but you never know.  

Infact there is quite a bit of activity and not just from random OS spiders and robots but actual hits.  

Anyway stay tutned for another learning adventure. If you feel like learing both these skills also then follow along and I'll show you where I go for my studies and how I go about achieveing my goals.
