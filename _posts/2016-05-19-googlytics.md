Google Analytics - Working towards another certification. 

I'm going to write up the steps I am taking to complete another 2 certifications. 

One for Google Analytics and the other for Google Adwords (this will be covered in a seperate post).  

My reason for learning both are that the Adwords is a well need marketing skill for any online business and having starting my own online startup over 12 months ago I need to start thinking about maximising what SEO potential there is.  
As for Google Analytics well if Adwords are in play I need to know about how effective they are, Analytics to the rescue. Not just for my startup but I'm interested to see what activity all of my various domains are getting.  

I have 7 active sites across 3 domains and as such I am very curious if they attract anyone at all, I suspect not as they were put online for my benefit and as such i never anticipated have an audience but you never know.  

In fact there is quite a bit of activity and not just from random OS spiders and robots but actual hits.  

Anyway stay tuned for another learning adventure.   

If you feel like learning both these skills also then follow along and I'll show you where I go for my studies and how I go about achieving my goals.  

One of the first things you will need to do apart from learning the skills is to sign up for some courses and to download the google documents provided for each subject.  

Once you get closer to having a working knowledge you will need to have a developer account so as to run up some adword campaigns and also to link google webmaster tools to your site so as the analytics robot can start to track activity.  

And then the next step before attempting to become certified will be to sign up and apply for Google Partner status.  

Ok so starting with Google Analytics using the Google Analytics Academy as our may resource.

May 21st 2016 - [Lesson 1 Digital Analytics Fundamentals](https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course/1/unit/1/lesson/1)

1. Course Overview:
The course should take between 4 and 6 hours including the tests and final assessment for which 80% of higher is required to get a certificate should that concern you. I personally don't worry about the certificate as I am here for the knowledge and to ultimately apply that to earn certification.  

2. Getting started with digital analytics  
2.1 **The importance of digital analytics**    
 * Understand what "digital measurement" means
 "Digital analytics is the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from your business and the competition to drive a continual improvement of the online experience that your customers and potential customers have which translates to your desired outcomes (both online and offline)".  
Avinash Kaushik  

An important step of digital analytics is understanding what your desired business objective and outcome is and how you plan to measure them.  
There are commonly 5 business objectives in the online world:
 -For ecommerce sites, an obvious objective is selling products or services.
 -For lead generation sites, the goal is to collect user information for sales teams to connect with potential leads.
 -For content publishers, the goal is to encourage engagement and frequent visitation.
 -For online informational or support sites, helping users find the information they need at the right time is of primary importance.
 -For branding, the main objective is to drive awareness, engagement and loyalty.
