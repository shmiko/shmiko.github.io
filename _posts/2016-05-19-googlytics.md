#### Googlytics 

Google Analytics - Working towards another certification. 

I'm going to write up the steps I am taking to complete another 2 certifications. 

One for Google Analytics and the other for Google Adwords (this will be covered in a seperate post).  

My reason for learning both are that the Adwords is a well need marketing skill for any online business and having starting my own online startup over 12 months ago I need to start thinking about maximising what SEO potential there is.  
As for Google Analytics well if Adwords are in play I need to know about how effective they are, Analytics to the rescue. Not just for my startup but I'm interested to see what activity all of my various domains are getting.  

I have 7 active sites across 3 domains and as such I am very curious if they attract anyone at all, I suspect not as they were put online for my benefit and as such i never anticipated have an audience but you never know.  

In fact there is quite a bit of activity and not just from random OS spiders and robots but actual hits.  

Anyway stay tuned for another learning adventure.   

If you feel like learning both these skills also then follow along and I'll show you where I go for my studies and how I go about achieving my goals.  

One of the first things you will need to do apart from learning the skills is to sign up for some courses and to download the google documents provided for each subject.  

Once you get closer to having a working knowledge you will need to have a developer account so as to run up some adword campaigns and also to link google webmaster tools to your site so as the analytics robot can start to track activity.  

And then the next step before attempting to become certified will be to sign up and apply for Google Partner status.  

Ok so starting with Google Analytics using the Google Analytics Academy as our may resource.  

There are 5 courses on offer.  

1.Digital Analytics Fundamentals  
2.Google Analytics Platform Principles  
3.Ecommerce Analytics: From Data to Decisions  
4.Mobile App Analytics Fundamentals  
5.Google Tag Manager Fundamentals

## 1. Course Overview:
The course should take between 4 and 6 hours including the tests and final assessment for which 80% of higher is required to get a certificate should that concern you. I personally don't worry about the certificate as I am here for the knowledge and to ultimately apply that to earn certification.  

## 2 Getting started with digital analytics  
### 2.1 **The importance of digital analytics**    
 - Understand what "digital measurement" means.  
 "Digital analytics is the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from your business and the competition to drive a continual improvement of the online experience that your customers and potential customers have which translates to your desired outcomes (both online and offline)".  
Avinash Kaushik  

An important step of digital analytics is understanding what your desired business objective and outcome is and how you plan to measure them.  
There are commonly 5 business objectives in the online world:
 - For ecommerce sites, an obvious objective is selling products or services.
 - For lead generation sites, the goal is to collect user information for sales teams to connect with potential leads.
 - For content publishers, the goal is to encourage engagement and frequent visitation.
 - For online informational or support sites, helping users find the information they need at the right time is of primary importance.
 - For branding, the main objective is to drive awareness, engagement and loyalty.

 * Recognise why digital analytics tools like Google Analytics are important to implement for your business

 Continual Improvement consists of 5 phases:
  1. Measure - Collecting data to answers business questions.  
  2. Report - Produce reports or dashboards to the decision makers so as to empower them to make business decisions.  
  3. Analyse - Identifying larger trends or to develop a hypothesis which reflects your expectations and figuring out why the numbers do or do not match.  
  4. Test - Try different solutions to the problems discovered through analysis.  
  5. Repeat the process to improve.  

### 2.2 Core analysis techniques  
 - Describe segmentation and why it is an important technique for good analysis.  

Segmentation  

Segmentation allows you to analyse subsets of data. You can segment your data my marketing channel. 
Understanding this allows you to see which channel is responsible for changes in your data.  

Understand the importance of using internal and external benchmarks to add context to your data.  

Context
Adding context to your data is very important and allows you to understand if performance is good or bad.  
Context can be set internally or externally.  

### 2.3 Conversions and conversion attribution   
 - Define the term "conversion"  

micro conversions, for example, signups for your email newsletter, account creations, and other activities that often precede a purchase.  
macro conversions, i.e. sales transactions  
Example:
email sign-up (micro conversion) > create account (micro conversion) > purchase.  

Explain how marketing attribution works in Google Analytics and why understanding attribution is important for good analysis.  
Attribution is assigning credit for a conversion.  

Understand the “last-click” attribution model versus other models.    
Rather than assign all of the value to the last channel, you might want to assign all of the value to the first channel, the one that started the user on the customer journey. This is called first-click attribution.  

### 2.4 Creating a measurement plan

Learn the five-step process for creating a measurement plan to track your online performance.
 - Define measurement plan  
 - Document technical infrastructure  
 - Create implementation plan  
 - Implement  
 - Maintain and refine  

Define meaningful goals, targets and segments
Step 1. Document business objectives
Step 2. Identify strategies and tactics  
Step 3. Choose KPIs  
Step 4. Choose segments  
Step 5. Choose targets  


Understand how your business objectives will influence what you track in Google Analytics
 - Define Business Objective - Eg. Help people enjoy the outdoors through innovative products and cultivate their love of the outdoors.  
 - Strategy - A) Sell Products  B) Engage Users  
 - Tactics - A1) Sell Online A2) Drive Store Visits  B1)Drive Blog Engagement  
 - KPIs - A1) Revenue $ A1) Average Order Value $  A2) Find Store Location A2) Printed Coupon  B1) Recency/Frequency B1) Social Share  
 - Segments - Marketing Channel, New vs Returning Customers, Geography  
 - Targets - Set Targets  

Implementation Plan  
 - Website Technologies to consider:  
 - Query string parameters  
 - Server redirects  
 - Flash and AJAX events  
 - Multiple domains and subdomains  
 - Responsive web design  

Common features are:  
Implement the standard Analytics tracking snippet. This gives you the bulk of the data you need.  
Determine how to track your KPIs. You can do this using goal tracking and the ecommerce module if you are an ecommerce business.  
Use filters to normalise your data so that your reports are accurate and useful.  
Use campaign tracking and AdWords linking to properly track marketing campaigns.  
Use custom dashboards and custom reports to simplify the reporting process.  

Maintain and Refine  
The final step is to maintain and refine the plan.  

## 3 Understanding and Using Google Analytics data   

### 3.1 How Google Analytics works
 - There are four main components to the Analytics system: data collection, configuration, data processing and reporting.  

 - Collection: You can use Analytics to collect user interaction data from websites, mobile apps, and digitally connected environments like kiosks or point of sale systems. For websites, Analytics uses JavaScript code to collect information. One package of information is referred to as a “hit” or an “interaction.” A “hit” is sent every time a user views a page tagged with Analytics. 
For mobile apps, you must add extra code to each "activity" you want to track. Note that since mobile devices are not always connected to the internet, data can not always be sent to the collection server in real time. To handle this situation, Analytics can store the “hits” and dispatch them to the server when the device reconnects to the internet. 
 - Processing: Once the hits from a user have been collected on Google’s servers, the next step is data processing. This is the “transformation” step that turns your raw data to something useful. 
 - Configuration: In this step, Analytics applies your configuration settings, such as filters, to the raw data. Once your data is processed, the data is stored in a database. Once the data has been processed and inserted into the database, it can’t be changed. 
 - Reporting: Typically, you will use the web interface at www.google.com/analytics to access your data. However, it is also possibly to systematically retrieve data from your Analytics account using your own application code and the Core Reporting API.

### 3.2 Key Metrics and dimensions defined  
 - Define the terms "metrics" and "dimensions" and identify examples of each in Google Analytics.  
 - Understand how key metrics like "users," "sessions," "bounce rate" and other interaction metrics are calculated.  
 - Understand how time metrics are calculated.  

Reports in Analytics contain dimensions and metrics. Most commonly, you’ll see dimensions and metrics reported in a table, with the first column containing a list of the values for one particular dimension, and the rest of the columns displaying the corresponding metrics.  
Dimensions describe characteristics of your users, their sessions and actions.  
Metrics are the quantitative measurements of users,sessions and actions. Metrics are numerical data.

## 4 Collectiong actionable data with Google Analytics     

### 4.1 Creating an account  
 - Practice the steps to create a Google Analytics account
 - Learn where to implement your Google Analytics code

When you first set up your Analytics account, you’ll be asked to choose whether you want to track a website or a mobile application. Depending on your choice, Analytics will display instructions to add the correct code to collect your data.    
If you’re tracking a website, then you will receive a piece of JavaScript code that you must add to every page of the site you want to track. It’s best to add this code to the top of the page, before the closing head tag. If your website uses a template, then you can add the code directly to that site template.  
If you’re tracking a mobile application you will download a mobile software development kit, or SDK, and share it with your development team. There’s an SDK for the Android platform as well as iOS.  
Once you add the code to your site, you should start to see data immediately in the Real-Time reports.  
Another way to add the Analytics tracking code to a site is by using a tag management tool, such as Google Tag Manager.  

### 4.2 Understanding your account  
 - Understand the hierarchy of a Google Analytics account and the meaning of the terms “Account," “Property” and “View”.  
 - Practice creating new properties and new views.  
 - Recognize how account structure affects which data can be viewed together in Google Analytics.  

An Analytics account is simply a logical way for a business to group data from all of its digital assets together. There are also certain configuration settings that you apply to your entire account, like managing the users who have access.  

Within each account, you can have one or more properties that independently collect data. Each property is assigned a unique tracking ID that tells Analytics exactly which data should be collected, stored and reported together. Typically you create separate accounts for unique businesses or distinct business units. Then you can create unique properties within that account for the different websites, mobile applications, or other digital assets that belong to the business.  

For each property, you have the option to create different views of your data. A view lets you define a unique perspective of the data from a parent property. You use the configuration settings in your account to define each view. You should have at least three views for each property.  

By default, you have one unfiltered view that is automatically generated when you create a property. Don’t apply any settings or configurations to this view since it is the backup for your data. Once you delete a view it’s gone forever. So having a backup view, like the unfiltered data view, is very useful.  
You should have a master view. This view should have all of the settings needed to transform your data into useful information.
You should have a test view. If you need to make changes to your configuration test them using this view first. Once you know the impact to the data you can then apply the same change to your master view.  
When you create a new view, Analytics does not automatically copy any of the historical data in the original view to the new view. You’ll only have data starting from the date you created the view.  


### 4.3 Setting up basic filters  
 - Understand how filters act on data.  
 - Practice creating a basic filter to exclude internal traffic from your business.  
 - Become familiar with other basic examples of using filters for GA.  
You can use filters to:  

exclude data  
include data  
change how the data looks in your reports  
Filters help you transform the data so it’s better aligned with your business needs.  

During processing, Analytics applies your filters to the raw data collected from your website or app. This transformed data is what you see in the reports for each view.  

For example, you can use a filter to exclude traffic from your internal employees. The easiest way to do this is to create a filter that excludes all of the data from the IP address for your business. As Analytics processes your data it will ignore any data coming from that IP address.  

You can also use a filter to clean up your data. For example, sometimes a website will show the same page regardless of the case of the URL uppercase, lowercase or mixed case. Since Analytics treats data as case sensitive, this can result in the same page showing up multiple times, based on case, in your reports. To prevent this separation and see the page data in aggregate, you can set up a lowercase filter to force all of the URLs to a single case.  

#### Create an IP address filter
 - To prevent internal traffic from affecting your data, you can use a filter to filter out traffic by IP address.  
 - You can find the public IP address you are currently using by searching "what is my ip address" on google.com. You can find out what IP addresses and subnets your company uses by asking your network administrator.  
To create an IP address filter:  
  
Follow the instructions to create a new filter for your view.  
Leave the Filter Type as  Predefined.  
Click the Select filter type drop-down menu and select Exclude.  
Click the Select source or destination drop-down menu and select traffic from the IP addresses.  
Click the Select expression drop-down menu and select the appropriate expression.  
Enter the IP address or a regular expression. See the examples below.  


### 4.4 Setting up goals and ecommerce  
 - Understand how to set up goals once you’ve put together your measurement plan.  
 - Recognize which types of actions can be tracked as goals.  
 - Understand how funnels can be used to analyze the path to conversion.  
 - Recall the steps to set up ecommerce tracking.  
 - Identify the difference between goal tracking and ecommerce tracking with Google Analytics.  

Setting up Goals in Analytics is one of the most important parts of implementation. Once you enable Goals, you get metrics like the number of conversions and the conversion rate. Goals are the way that we map the data in Analytics to the key performance indicators that you defined in your measurement plan. These metrics are always available in the Conversion section of your standard reports. But you can also find these metrics in almost every other report in Analytics. This is useful because the reports allow you to segment your conversion data.  

Anytime you think of conversions, you should think about “macro conversions” and “micro conversions.” Macro conversions are your primary business objectives. Micro conversions are the relationship building activities that lead up to a macro conversion.  

Goals are configured at the view level. That means you can create different Goals for each view. There are four types of Goals.  

A Destination Goal is a page on your website that users see when they complete an activity. For an account signup, this might be the “thank you for signing up” page. For a purchase this might be the receipt page. A destination Goal triggers a conversion when a user views the page you’ve specified. If you’re setting up a Goal for an app, you’d set up a screen view Goal rather than a destination Goal.  
An Event Goal is triggered when a user does something specific like downloading a PDF or starting a video. You need to have Event Tracking implemented on your website in order to use this type of Goal.  
A Pages per Visit Goal is triggered when a user sees more or fewer pages than a threshold that you specify.  
A Duration Goal is triggered when a user’s visit exceeds or falls below a threshold that you set.  
There is an important difference between Goal conversions and ecommerce transactions. A Goal conversion can only be counted once during a visit, but an ecommerce transaction can be counted multiple times during a visit. Here’s an example. Let’s say that you set one of your Goals to be a PDF download and you define it such that any PDF download is a valid Goal conversion. And let’s also say that the Goal is worth $5. In this case, if a user comes to your site and downloads five PDF files during a single session, you’ll only get one conversion worth $5. However, if you were to track each of these downloads as a $5 ecommerce transaction, you would see five transactions and $25 in ecommerce revenue.  

As a best practice, you should only add a Goal value for nonecommerce Goals. The reason is that Goal value is cumulative. If you add a Goal value and you track transactions with the ecommerce tracking code, Analytics will add the value of the transaction to the value of the Goal.  


### 4.5 Collecting campaign data  
 - Recognize standard acquisition dimensions and understand how traffic sources are categorized in Google Analytics by default.  
 - Understand the importance of correctly categorizing your acquisition sources in Google Analytics.  
 - Become familiar with custom campaign link tagging and practice using the URL builder to create manual tags for an example campaign.  


## 5 Navigating Google Analytics Reports  

### 5.1 Reporting Overview  
Become familiar with the standard report layout and report organization.  
Perform common reporting tasks like setting date ranges, graphing data and filtering and sorting tables.
