## Javascript Algorithms - Sets

-- Sets are a data structure of unordered lists of related elements where each element is unique.  
A set with zero elements is referred to as a null set.  

### Sets:  

##### Using Sets 

The two most common methods for basic stack operations are union, intersection and difference.    

The union operation is when a new set is created by combining all the elements of one set with those of another set.      

The intersection operation is when a new set is created by adding all the elements of one set that also exist in the second set.  

The difference operation is when a new set is created by adding all elements of one set except for those elements which exist in the second set.  


```javascript



```
ES6 - includes a native set object. It is now being used in browsers and will soon have full support.  
It would be a best practise to start using the ES6 set structure.  
An advantage of this set object is that it force all keys to be a string like the object does, so keys of 10 and "10" act as seperate keys.  


Next we will look at Javascript sets.
