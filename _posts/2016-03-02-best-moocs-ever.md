** The Best MOOC Courses Ever!  

I'm going to list the best MOOC courses ever.  
I have been a life long learner forever and in the last 3 years have been throug over 100 MOOC's and those are the ones I have finished.  

I wont list them all but I will start by listing the top 10.  

I guess I will also limit these to being FREE courses and in a future post list the top 10 Paid MOOCS.

But the bottom line is DONT WAIT TO LEARN, there are amazing online courses which can be the difference between starting to learn something or better still continuing to learn something, this can open a whole array of opportunities not to mention being very empowering.  

Well here goes...  

Firstly the colleges..

1. EDx - Awesome resource for free learning and each course has a certification path which you pay for. Most are self paced but some require you to follow along with a schedule. These tend to be non beginner course but some are at a starting level.
2. Plurasight - A Paid college but well worth it, the quality or education is 2nd to none.
3. Khan Academy - Needless to say this is curriculum based but all free and fun, really make you learn.
4. Coursera - Amazing selection, this place is a must visit.
5. Udemy - Another place that is a must see, many free courses but most value is in the paid courses.
6. Udacity - This is much higher level and bellieve me if you can finish these you will have learn't valuable skills, not just theory.


There is heaps more come....
