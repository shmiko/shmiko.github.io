The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win
by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford - 
Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited.  
It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO.  
The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late.  
The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced.  
With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined.  
With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited.  
In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize.  
Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again.

My review....
A great read to say the least.  
Highly relevant insights how a dysfunctional company takes on challenges to solve the problems facing IT departments within the organisation.  
Through dealing with bureaucracy from upper management the author illustrates real-world examples and suggests practical ways of dealing with and combating the problems faced in making a lean mean IT team.  
Based on the Three Ways Principle - System Thinking, Amplify Feedback Loops and Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning the book is very entertaining and certainly not what I was expecting.  
If you're not in IT then you will walk away with a better understanding of what it is like to have a full-time role in IT.  
Software Devs and IT Ops alike will enjoy reading this book and will likely relate to many situations and hopefully garner ways in which to approach their own problems, and in turn learn about deployment automation, continuous integration and walk away with some new found knowledge embracing the theory of constraints and other agile methodologies helping to ease bottlenecks commonly found in IT departments.
