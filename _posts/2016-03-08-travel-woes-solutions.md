# Travel Woes - Solutions**

## Problems that we can fix

- **Plane boarding.**   

Let paint the picture.

You are traveling as a family of four, you have rows 51 and 52 which are the 2 back rows. When the time comes to board you go last? This causes so many issues it is not funny. The first 50 rows of people are all busily placing their carry on's in the overhead compartment and or perhaps sorting their onboard flight entertainment whilst standing in the walkway. So you need to struggle for 50 rows worth of people who will not make any room for people to pass. Wouldn't it be smart to let those people at the back of the plane board first so as to leave the walkway clear for those following.  

A: This occurs on every flight, even if you happen to board towards the front of the plane i.e. rows 15-20, people will still line up to board regardless of their position on the plane. Due diligence would sort this but we cannot simply rely on airport staff to do the right thing.  

B: This problem is not so much about time lost but the stress you get when having to abide by the unwritten rules and doing the right and courteous thing.  

C: the flow on effect grows in magnitude according to the size of the plane, a larger plane attracts more people so the odds are that more people will already be aware of the issue and try to circumvent this by cheating their way onto the plane early.  

D: To fix this we could have a chip or magnetic strip within the boarding pass which is electronically activated based on previously boarded guests in accordance with their row number. If for example there are special circumstances such as parents with young ones they would already have a specific magnetic strip encoded as such when allocated their boarding passes. Anyone who tries to claim early entry without having properly sort the earlier recognition of such needs would trigger an alert which would prohibit them from boarding until there time is up.

- **Departing the plane.**  

This is in fact opposite of the boarding issue, rows 51 & 52 should wait until all other rows have at least started to depart, this is just common sense. Whilst is is very common to see people in the later rows jump up and stand in the walkway waiting for 10 minutes before they can start to exit, meanwhile all those people who are at the closer to the exit need to wait for space to even collect their belonging, common sense should dictate that those at the rear should wait, it should be the opposite rule for boarding as stated above.  

A: This also occurs for every flight. this is a significant waste of time especially when your carry on bags have been placed 5 rows in front of where you were seated due to overcrowding in the overhead compartments at take off time.  

B: This can also be avoided by having sensors in the overhead areas which scan luggage tags to ensure they match up with the person assigned to their seat in the specific row, the size and weight could be tracked and obviously the number of items could be managed far more efficiently. The luggage tags would also have the same associated encoded strip which would directly relate to the passenger and to their seat allocation.

- **Collecting Baggage.**  

When it comes time to collect your baggage more often or not you will see similar coordination issues around the carousel. Lets use the rows 51 and 52 scenario as an example. Lets say you have waited a good 20 minutes for rows 1 thru 50 to exit the plane, you can bet your bottom dollar that you bags will somehow be going around that carousel numerous times before you even arrive. But you will find it hard to find a place to stand as it is so crowded and directly in front of the carousel are so many children playing touchy feelies with the merry go round that it is near impossible to get to your bags, so you just watch them go around again. It is yet again a lacking of common sense that governs how the bags are loaded and unloaded. One would think that if the airline coordinated the luggage in accordance to row numbers and applied some logic to boarding and exiting the plane that the carousel area would be far less impacted and could in fact operate quite smoothly. People could actually plan and allocate the time requited to best determine when to arrive at the carousel thus allowing room for those watching their bags travel around from afar.  

A: This is more about consideration for others but it can be managed by the carriers and eliminate a lot of stress which arises at this time. Normally you have been waiting a long time due to the time to depart from the plane and if you don't have an express passport more time waiting to be passed via the customs officer. No one wants to wait any longer than they have to especially when it can have significant ramifications like missing your transport and incurring costs due to the transport company having to wait also.  

B: Lets consider what we could do to reduce the angst involved in baggage collection. Lets assume yet again that bags have RFID or magnetic strips which when they pass certain steps in the baggage handlers process would determine when they go or be rerouted. the passenger has departed the plane and as such their boarding pass would trigger at a point leaving the aircraft, this in turn will allow the bags as such to know where the passenger is in relation to the baggage collection carousel. Lets assume the passenger has yet to pass through the passport checkpoint, the bags tags would know this and accordingly continue to delay sending the bags through. If they have passed through that checkpoint then the bags would be aware of such an event and time it so as the bags would be arriving at the same time or within minutes of the passenger being ready to collect their bags. Imagine the reduction I waiting and the less people there would be to struggle pass just to try and get to your bags.
