## Follow on from 12th:  

To Do: Death Valley – badwater salt flats, artists drive – pallette, golden canyon, Lunch at Pioneer Village, drive to Pasadena, late night looking for food, went to Hausdog. Went to vromans bookstore.

In Death Valley there are some pretty amazing facts such as it being the hottest place on earth and the lowest point on earth also. Not far from where we stayed at Furnace Creek was a place called Badwater, this was named after pioneers noticed that their horses wouldn't drink the water, this being due to the saline content. There are massive salt flats which you can walk onto for miles and miles of white, this was a different kind of experience but despite there being so many warnings about not to touch and especially not to eat the salt there were families who just didn;t care that their kids were placing the salt covered hands into their mouths, seems so stupid to me and confirms that they are definitely not the smartest bunch of people.

In addition to Badwater the place is surrounded by mountains which have the most amazing colors, one such place is called Artists Palette which give the opportunity to drive though the canyons to see up close the amazing colors and textures of the mountains. On the way out of we stopped at a place called Shoshone where the seemed to be about 4 buildings, one of which was a small place to eat some nice typical american roadside dinner meals. I forget what we ate but it was nice. I think Jack and I have tacos, Wendy may have had Nachos and not sure what Lilia had.

There was a small museum which I went into but the kids and Wendy were not interested so I cut my visit short so as we could continue on. I did buy the kids a small rock from the shop and these rocks were so colorful, full of iridescent colors, purples, yellow etc. I gave the museum a donation in addition to buying these small rocks.

On the way back we had an amazing drive and made exellent ime as I was driving on these massive long strecthes of road and the car we have just flys, 150 kms/h, so cool.

We were heaed for Pasadena now and we arrived about 6pm, checked into the Couryard Marriot Hotel. We unpacked the bags and went walking around the town of Old Pasadena. This place is filled with historical building and the place is amazing. We wandered the streets looking for somewhere to eat that wouldn't cost $100's as most places do, we eventually found a place called Hausedog, a german sausage place. We were starving and the food was nice nd cheap and good.

We then went back to the hotel to get an early night ready for another early start tomorrow where we will be heading to the wordls largets flea markets.
I discovered a late night book shop which put our niggest bookstores to shame, this place was 3 levels and full of people at 10pm. I bought 2 books, both what are known as “Then and Now” books which show photographs from the earliest known photos of known landmarks compared to a photo taken from the same location and perspective, these are my favorite type of books. I got one on San Fran and also one on California.

## Sunday 13th 2015

Left Courtyard Marriott at Pasadena to go to the worlds largest flea market, there would have been more than 1000 vendors, lot's of antiques, vintage clothes, toys etc. We picked up some American Girl Doll and clothes, some star wars figures for Jack and Wendy got a present for someone back home.

After the markets we went to look for some new Nike's for Jack, he chose Yellow and grey fluorescent shoes, they look nice. We then went to find Jack some PS4 games and he chose Rainbow 6, Lilia bought a Tsum Tsum.
We then headed toward Ragged Point which was a 4 hour drive up the coast on Highway 101, unfortunately it was raining very heavy and we really didn't get to enjoy the coastline.

We arrived at about 6pm and it was windy and cold. Apparently earlier in the day they got very heavy rain which we were lucky to miss. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant. Wendy had spaghetti and meatballs, Lilia had fish n chips, jack had a cheeseburger and curly fries and I had chicken drumsticks, we all enjoyed the meal. The waiter wasn't able to give me a Vodka and Orange and suggested another orange drink which was alcoholic, (back water distillery) but I could only get through the smallest amount as it went straight to my head. We stopped by the gift shop and bought a few souvenirs.

Internet connection is scatty, equipment goes flat and we are packing heaps in so posts will be fewer than our last trip.
We will be up very early as we are overlooking the ocean and there are so many photo ops.



## Monday 14th 2015

Since our hotel room is overlooking the cliff onto the ocean it was a perfect spot for some pre morning photos, so I was up at a little after 5am and was out taking photos in what felt like -10 degrees. It was so dark I couldn't see where I was walking so I basically just stayed in the one place right on the edge behind the safety fence but being so cold I had many shaky photos as I just couldn't trigger the camera without shaking from the cold. The photos turned out quite nice and you'll be amazed at the views. At about 6:30 Wendy woke and soon after the kids too as we had all planned on taking in the scenery via a few little walks around the resort area. The views are endless and just so amazing. There are walkways that lead down 300 – 500 foot cliffs where there are private beaches, private waterfalls and a small space for the public should they wish to endure the doable but “At you own risk walk”, needless to say Wendy wasn't keen so we skipped it.

After a 20 minute walk around the grounds and the gardens we filled up with petrol at the Inn's petrol station where they kindly charge 2 times what the normal price for petrol was, to fill up ¾ of a tank was over $100, normally it was just under $60, but they are pretty well the only place for miles so no arguments. The kids had a quick pat of a nice little ginger cat who was having fun running up and down this little tree but was friendly enough to play with.


The drive out was one lane only as it was very curvy, it wouldn't have been easy to negotiate the drive at night time as it would have been a little scary given there are no side rails and a significant drop over the cliffs. In one of the many books I have already bought it suggests that at various spot along the coast there are many car wrecks that have miss calculated the turn and went over the edge, not a very nice thought. We drove pretty slowly as we had a truck and a couple of small cars that were no match to the power we had at our disposal, so the one and only overtaking opportunity I went for it and made a break, however after pulling in at a view point some time later they both went past me as we were pulling back out, so we plodded along for another hour or so until we left the curve of the mountains and hit some flats ground with somewhere to eat. We stopped at a new takeout place called CHOPOTLE which is a Mexican grill serving the usual enchilada's, tacos and baritos. After a short stop we were back on the road again heading to San Jose area for two upcoming attractions.

The first stop was at Santa Cruz which is still pretty much on the coast about an hour away from San Jose. At Santa Cruz they had an awesome boardwalk and massive adventure like timezone place with all sorts of electronic games such as star wars and air hockey etc. We bought the kids $20 worth of tokens each which was a 2 for 1 deal. Near the end of play Jack had a go on a game to try and win more tickets to play more, he won 4, then I said I would have a go as it was based on pulling a lever as hard as possible to spin a big wheel, well you wouldn't believe it but I won the biggest jackpot which was 1000 tickets. It took about 8 minutes for the tickets to accumulate onto the electronic card at which time the kids were then able to select froma whole range of gifts etc. There wasn't anything Jack wanted so he kindly offered his half to Lilia who was able to get some thing she really wanted which was a Minecraft Pig, we also got a little metal keyring for me which is a Santa Crus number plate keyring. Needless to say we made it up to Jack in other ways later in the day.
After the game center we drove down the mile long boardwalk for a look, tried to buy some hot chips but for some reason the americans just look at you with a stupid look on there faces as they just have no idea what chips are, if you don't say fries then you get corn chips as we discovered on more than one occasion.


We didn't spend too long there as we had to be at San Jose area for a special attraction called the Mystery Spot. This place is in the middle of a wilderness forrest of redwoods and gumtrees and was discovered about 70 years ago. This place has been featured on Time magazine back in the late 40's and ever since in many publications and shows due to the weird things that occur to physical things.
Basically there seems to be forces at work which play with time and space and distort reality. Such example were a house that was built in the 1930's had apparently slid 50 feet down a steep hill to find it final resting place where the building had a 30 degree lean on it, as you walk through you can feel strange things that cause you to either feel off balance of just plain weird. The whole place is on a significant lean and some of the strange things they show you are for example a lever plank of wood where water and balls go uphill??? Other anomalies are where the is a 30 pound pendulum which despite having some weight to it will not stay perfectly vertical. Other strange things were where 4 people would stand next to each other ( me included this time ) in order from tallest to shortest, when we switched places those that were tallest were now considerably shorter than those who were the shortest. Very strange. A short tours concluded after about 30 minutes or so but was definitely a highlight. After researching a little it seems there are many theories about what is happening but the most sound seems t be based around the principles of multi-dimensional reality, now I have a book if you want to know more but at this point it's over my head.


It was now about 3:00pm and we headed off to one of my all time favorite places, the Winchester Mystery House. Since our booking wasn't until 5pm we had some time to kill at a local Westfield Shopping Center. Jack went to buy some lego at the lego shop and Lilia was looking at kids clothing shops she had been wanting to visit since being here.


We were ready for the mystery house tour a little early so wandered the gift shop and played a few mysterious antique game until we were called to commence the tour. This will be my 3rd visit here and I never get sick of it. We had pre booked for the last tour of the day which was for 5pm and after the sun had set so there was an element of spookiness in the dark. Once again they strictly prohibit photos, so all we got between us was about 30 photos lol...... It was a great tour much of which we remembered so much so that the guide would ask questions of the very small tour group and Jack was able to answer correctly a couple as was I, needless to say we didn't let on we had visited not too long ago hence why we knew the answers, that was a little funny.

Another obligatory book needed to be bought from the gift shop and well Wendy bought a really nice antique reproduction map of NYC which she will have framed.

Our hotel was only 10 minutes away called the DoubleTree by Hilton at San Jose. The rooms were nice and comfy and after a short while we had all settled in for the night.



## Tuesday 15th 2015 – 10 days to Christmas and you can tell it is close as there are Chrissy trees everywhere.

I am up at 4am today, went for a short walk in the freezing outdoors and once I could no longer feel my ears I went back and finished the blog update for the last 2 days.

Today we are heading off to San Fransisco where we will stay for 2 nights.

Remember the internet via our phone that we paid $300 for isn't working as well as one would hope so the idea of posting photos and blog updates has fallen by the wayside and we will probably be updating whenever I get the chance. We are getting your message but you need not worry nor have to check every day as you know now that having sporadic internet means less frequent updates.


Everything is fine though and we are having the best time. Far too many photos to upload sorry, so you have only seen a few that Wendy and Lilia post via Instagram.


We would love to know that the cats are alright Sue???
