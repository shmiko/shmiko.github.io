## Hotel Distribution Metrics!  

Hotel Distribution is a demanding and highly competitive field and with the introduction of metasearch sites all the more competitive it has become.  
There is a critical need to understand the following performance metrics in order to understand and track hotel performance.   

In no particular order we'll highlight the following metrics to be used to understand operating profits and capital gains for independant and chain hotels.   
Understanding these metrics is key to maximise occupancy rates and the contribution margin generated to offset fixed cost base to generate profit.  

- **Occupancy Rate (OCC).  
- **Revenue per room (RevPar).  
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR).  
- **Market penetration index (MPI).  
- **Average rate index (ARI).  
- **Revenue generation index (RGI).  

These metrics are taught through a coursera course called The Fundamentals of Hotel Distribution which I absolutley recommend.  
[Hotel Distribution Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hotel-distribution/home/info) The Fundamentals of Hotel Distribution.  

*Occupancy Rate* (OCC) is a percentage of available rooms being occupied for a period of time and can be calculated 2 different ways:  
	1. Paid Rooms Occupied / Rooms Available = Occupancy Rate as %  
	2. Revenue per Room Available / Average Daily Rate (ADR) [Shown below]  
	eg. 50 / 100 = 50% OCC ( 50 rooms occupied of a total of 100 rooms )  

*Revenue Per Room* (RevPar) is a measurement of the average dailt room revenue per available room also calculated 2 ways:  
	1. Total Room Revenue / Total Rooms Available  
	2. Occupancy as % X Average Daily Rate (ADR)  
	eg 1. 500000 / 10000 = $50 RevPar  
	eg 2. 50% X $100 = $50 RevPar

*Average Daily Rate* (ADR) is essentially the average price paid for each room calculated 2 ways as:  
	1. Rooms Revenue / Paid Rooms Occupied  
	2. Revenue per Available Room / OCC %  
	eg. 50 / .50 = $100 ADR  

*Market Penetration Index* (MPI) is a measurement of Hotel occupancy compared to other hotels, or market share. Calculated as:  
	1. Hotel Occupancy % / Market Occupancy %  
	eg. 60% / 50% = 120% MPI - this is indicating the hotel achieved an occupancy rate of 120% of it's OCC
	Results over 1 suggest being above market perfomance.  

*Average Rate Index* (ARI) calculates Hotel's average daily rate compared to other hotels.  
	1. ADR / Market ADR  
	A Competitive Set of data is required to calculate this, generally ADR / comp set X 100.  
	Having greater than 1 indicates good market share.  

*Revenue Generation Index* (RGI) is a calculation of Hotel RevPar compared to other hotels, calculated as:  
	1. RevPar / Market RevPar = RGI  
	A Competitive Set of data is required to calculate this, generally RevPar / comp set X 100.  
	A result of 1 or more suggests higher market share.
