#### What Ever Happened to Good Manners

I am just amazed at how people have lost good manners.  

![Good Manners](/img/goodmanners.jpg "Good Manners")

Bad Manners seem to be more common and poor etiquette similarly seems to be just as common. 

So is it that common sense has fallen by the wayside? Seriously what is going on with people today?

I scoured the net to see what the consensus was and here are some thoughts that seems to be common topics.

How many times do you wish someone well or for them to have a nice day, and what is there response, nothing at all, not even a thank you let-alone a "You Have a nice day too"?  

What is so hard about reciprocating courtesy or politeness or to show some etiquette or to offer a polite gesture?

It isn't just me, there are a few articles around that suggest others have also recognised that manners are no longer a concern.  
See this article written by Sarah Stealey Reed... [Emily Post is pissed enough with the bad manners](https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/emily-post-enough-with-the-bad-manners/).

I wonder how can kids will learn good manners when those who should be leading by example fail to show good manners?

You have probably opened the door for someone recently and had them not even thank you? 
Or perhaps the person in front of you walks through the door and doesn't bother to hold the door open for you. That is simply bad manners.  

When was the last time you offered to help someone in need, perhaps someone has dropped something, did you pick it up or offer help them?  
When did you last help someone who was looking at a map obviously lost?  
Even if you don't speak their language offering to help is better than just leaving them to struggle. 
No it isn't the rule that you should help those less fortunate that us or to offer some assistance to someone who obviously needs it, 
but it is so simple to be courteous and to offer little things that go along way to improve humanity through kindness and politeness.  

How often do children fail to stand up on public transport for elderly or pregnant women, all too often. It is very disrespectful and show bad manners, 
and worse to see that their parents make no effort to suggest otherwise.  
I'm sure there will be a people who think why should you bother, but really it is just showing some respect, especially showing respect to your elders, 
it is important. And it doesn't take much effort to extend that kind of courtesy. 

How often do you see people driving in the lane beside you that just dart in front of you without a single gesture of thanks, 
surely that is just being rude lazy.  

### Workplace Manners and Respect  

In the workplace so many things could be done to improve how people perform and yet the simplest of things just get completely forgotten?  
Is it really that hard to be nice to the people who are working fo you?  

Have you had a 10th anniversary at work or reach a milestone? Perhaps you have taken on some external studies in your own time to benefit your role. 
You would think it warrants a thank you or a note or some kind of mention wouldn't you. 
To have that moment or occasion ignored is the height of rudeness and disrespect and will do nothing to help your staff feel like it was 
worthwhile.  
It certainly would go to along way improve employee relations by acknowledging such an achievement and make people feel proud of themselves, 
instead you run the very real risk that they will soon be looking for a job elsewhere.  Doesn't common sense prevail? 
No one would be expecting a gold watch, perhaps just a thank you note wouldn't be too much to ask. 

Would it be too much to ask that company executives look people in the eye and just acknowledge them, instead they shun them like they are a 2nd class 
citizen. At that executive level, if you don't have the people skills to interact on all levels then why are you in that role??? It is just rude and impolite. 

Have you ever thought that it might be appropriate to offer some positive reinforcement about a colleagues job or task that they are doing well? 
It doesn't take much and you can be absolutely sure it will make them feel good. 
Furthermore it doesn't take much to lead by example even if you are not in a leadership role, 
and don't stop doing it if you already do, and additionally don't get disheartened because no-one reciprocates the favor or show you the same level of respect.
Think about showing the lame level of respect next time someone takes the time to compliment you or offer some encouragement, wait for the opportunity to respond accordingly. 
You will feel better for doing so.

If you have a bad day and end up having a dummy spit or saying something wrong to someone, or if you know you have been rude or were disrespectful then dig deep and apologise. 
No one should ever respond negatively to a sincere apology if it is said with sincerity and confidence. 

When you think it is ok to just ignore emails from colleagues requesting information then you are wrong, always respond within a couple of days, any longer is showing a non caring attitude and is certainly not conducive to a good working environment. You are potentially impacting on their ability to do their job properly and it leads to everyone using the blame game to explain and justify why things don't get done. Be in control and organise yourself properly so as you can answer all non junk emails.  
Even if it is a quick acknowledgement that you will respond at a later time, but if you do say that then make sure you follow up, it is just good manners to do so and shows respect for others.  

Many people are looking for work, and having spent a lot of time refining their CV they apply in response to an advertised position. 
Never hearing back is wrong, a simple auto responded email explaining that if there is no response sent within a week than assume you are unsuccessful, not hard to do and far nicer that just simply ignoring the person who took the time to respond to the advertisement.  Even this is an approach that could certainly be improved. Imagine actually taking the time to personalise a response and give some positive feedback to the unsuccessful applicants, the benefit for those people would be huge as they can start targeting those reasons to increase their chances of success.

As for etiquette in the workplace and not wanting to repeat what has been said in other articles that I have linked to, eating at your desk if fine, but is it really necessary to eat with your mouth open, or to make noises whilst you eat which are just disgustingly rude and so off-putting? It's not actually.

Just be nice, have some manners and show some courtesy and a little respect for you co-workers, who knows it might just catch on?

Here are some more thoughts about workplace etiquette..written by Maureen Mackey. [5 Outrageous Workplace Etiquette Mistakes](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/11/5-Outrageous-Workplace-Etiquette-Mistakes)

### Have you wondered about online etiquette?

There are many articles about which suggest the do's and do not's. Like this one for example written by the Jomer Gregorio at [cjgdigitalmarketing](http://cjgdigitalmarketing.com/top-8-social-media-etiquette-for-business-infographic/) or this article written by Outbound Engine [Social Media Etiquette for Business: 25 Do's & Don'ts](http://www.outboundengine.com/blog/social-media-etiquette-for-business-25-dos-donts/).  

Have you offered an endorsement on linkedin for a friend or co-worker to confirm a known and warranted skill? Yet did you get the favor returned, I suspect not. It may not be of any concern to you but ask yourself why the feature exists?
People should realise that LinkedIn is all about networking and networked connections often rely on having those positive reinforcements made though respected peers. Networking is about increasing business, or reaching out for new opportunities and simply ignoring justified acknowledgments of skills is not right. 

Unless it is really not justified to offer an endorsement or reciprocate the recommendation you may have received, then just do the right thing. 
   
If you think sharing your email accounts contacts list of recipients, just because LinkedIn allow it, is a good idea, then think again. Playing a popularity game by trying to get 500+ connections will eventually be counter productive and many people are now looking at these tactics as showing poor etiquette as it is a faceless way of interacting with and reaching out to others.
   
Don't just connect to anyone for the sake of increasing your connection count, send a personalised message at the very least?  Show some interest in the person you are connecting to, if you cannot do that and have no reason to connect then don't.
Similarly if you do get a personalised message to connect to someone then it really doesn't hurt to respond either. If you don't want to connect then acknowledge the effort and respond.

It's all too easy to respond and accept a meeting invite, but just take a minute to think about it first and if you really have no intention of going then do not accept it.  That is common courtesy and sets the expectation for people for the event.  

If you get an email from a friend asking about how you have been, don't just ignore it, take a minute to respond and reciprocate the favor, it's good manners. 

I know I am far from perfect but I know with absolute confidence that I have good manners, I show respect, I am polite and courteous. This post is a good reminder for me to continue being mindful of such things.  

Having lived in Japan, a lot of these traits are instilled into you through the Japanese culture. 
This is evident in how there society acts as a whole, and how they respond to the customers need as well as how younger generations have the utmost respect to senior people. 
I have noticed similar instances of courtesy and respect throughout the US, although unfortunately this has been in steady decline over the last 15 years. 
This is a real shame as I have always considered the US leaders, I have on many occasions let my children learn from their society and how respectful and courteous people are.

I'd like to see what people have to say, but remember, be respectful when leaving comments. 
You can still tell it how is and how you see it, but still offer constructive input without having to resort to being rude and showing bad manners.
