## Mathematics Tricks



1. Easy **Square Numbers**


**1.**  Easy **Square Numbers** for any 2 digit Numbers x^2  
EXAMPLE  
17^2 - Round number up or down to closest 10.    
so 17^2 would round up to 20 which is a count of 3.  
So calculation is 17 + 3 = 20 X 17 - 3 = 14  
Read as 20 X 14 = 280  
Now add count^2 which is 3^2 = 9  
So 280 + 9 = **289**  

ANOTHER EXAMPLE  
63^2  
Round down to 60 meaning a count of 3  
So 63 - 3 = 60 X 63 + 3 = 66  
Read as 60 X 66 = 3960  
Add 3^2 = 9  
So 3600 + 9 = **3969**
