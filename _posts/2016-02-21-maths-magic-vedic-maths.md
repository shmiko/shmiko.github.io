**1.** **Vedic** Maths -   

* **Multiplication**  
*
** Multiply 2 and 3 Digit Numbers  

Select any two numbers and deduct the rightmost digits, i.e., 'unit digit' from both the numerals. The results derived after subtraction of the numbers from unit digits should be 'Equal'. Vedic maths multiplication concept is applicable for all the digits.
**Example 1:**
*** Step 1:
Let us consider multiplying any two digit numbers, for example 23 x 24.
*** Step 2:
Choose the unit digit of both the numerals and deduct it from the given numerals.
23 - 3 = 20
24 - 4 = 20
*** Step 3:
Now, select any one number (24) and add it with unit digit of another number(3)
24 + 3 = 27
*** Step 4:
Then, multiply the result obtained in step 2 and step 3.
27 x 20 = 540
*** Step 5:
Multiply the unit digit values.
4 * 3 = 12
*** Step 6:
Finally, add values obtained from step 3 and step 4.
540 + 12 = 552
23 x 24 = 552

** Example 2:  
*** Step 1:
Let us consider multiplication of three digit numbers 208 x 206.
*** Step 2:
Now, deduct the last digit from the respective numerals.
208 - 8 = 200
206 - 6 = 200
*** Step 3:
Pick any one number and add it with the unit digit of another number.
208 + 6 = 214
*** Step 4:
Now, multiply the result obtained in step 1 and step 2.
214 * 200 = 42800
*** Step 5:
Then, multiply the unit digits of the given numbers.
8 * 6 = 48
*** Step 6:
Add the values obtained in step 4 and step 5.
42800 + 48 = 42848
208 x 206 = 42848

** Multiply by 9's  

*** Step 1. Subtract the given multiplicand value by 1.
*** Step 2. Find the complement of multiplicand (Base value - Multiplicand value).
*** Step 3. Find the digit difference by subtracting multiplicand digit with multiplier digit. Assign (n).
*** Step 4. Start Step 1 value, next append step 3 (n) number of 9's and Step 2 value.
**Example:** 45 x 999 (Multiplicand Digits Less than Multiplier Digits)
*** Step 1: 45 -1 = 44
*** Step 2: Complement of 45 is 55 (that is 100 - 45)
*** Step 3: Number of digit Difference from multiplier and multiplicand n = 3-2 = 1
*** Step 4: 44955 (Final answer)  

---  


** Multiply with Base of 100
*** Step 1: Add multiplicand with a value (Multiplier-100), then multiply by 100.
*** Step 2: x = (multiplicand-100), y = (multiplier-100).
*** Step 3: Multiply x and y.
*** Step 4: Add rule 1 result with the rule 3 result. Its a final result.  
**Example:** 105 X 107
*** Step 1: (105 + 7) X 100 = 112 X 100 = 11200
*** Step 2: x = 105 - 100 = 5, y = 107 - 100 = 7
*** Step 3: 5 X 7 = 35
*** Step 4: = 11200 + 35 = 11235
 105 X 107 = 11235  

 ---  

** Multiply by 9's
*** Step 1: Subtract the given multiplicand value by 1.
*** Step 2: Find the complement of multiplicand (Base value - Multiplicand value).
*** Step 3: Append step 1 with step 2.
**Example:** 456 x 999 (Multiplicand and Multiplier Digits are Same)
*** Step 1: 456 -1 = 455
*** Step 2: Complement of 456 is 544 (that is 1000 - 456)
*** Step 3: 455544 (Its a final answer)

** Multiplication of Numbers Above the Base Number  
*** Step 1: Reduce the base values from the multiplier and multiplicand.
*** Step 2: Cross section the multiplier and multiplicand and add to the reduced values. You will get same difference on both the sides.
*** Step 3: Multiply the reduced numbers.
*** Step 4: If the resultant value is less than the base value assign zero before the resultant value to equal the base value digits. If the resultant value is greater than the base value carry the one.
*** Step 5: If you get carry values, add it to the difference values.
*** Step 6: Join both the values to get the final result.
**Example 1:** 106 X 108
Here base value is 100
*** Step 1: , 106 - 100 = 6 and 108 - 100 = 8
*** Step 2: 106 + 8 = 114 ; 108 + 6 = 114
*** Step 3: 6 x 8 = 48
*** Step 4: Here the obtained value is less than the base value. So there is no carry value.
*** Step 5: Join both the values (106 x 108 = 11448)
**Example 2:** 1023 X 1049
Here base value is 1000
*** Step 1: , 1023 - 1000 = 23 and 1049 - 1000 = 49
*** Step 2: 1023 + 49 = 1072 ; 1049 + 23 = 1072
*** Step 3: 23 x 49 = 1127.
*** Step 4: Here the resultant value is greater than the base value. Carry the remainder 1. So the value is 127.
*** Step 5: 1072 + 1 = 1073
*** Step 6: Append the resultant values (1023 x 1049 = 1073127)
Thus, the multiplicatin of two numbers that are below the base number can be done using the vedic maths multiplication.

** Multiplication of Numbers Below the Base Number  
*** Step 1. Reduce numbers from the base values.
*** Step 2. Cross section the multiplier and multiplicand and add it to the reduced values. You will get same difference on both the sides.
*** Step 3. Multiply the reduced values. If the resultant value is less than the base value add zero before it. If the resultant value is greater than the base value carry the remainder 1.
*** Step 4. Add the carry value with the difference value.
*** Step 5. Append both the values to get the final result.
**Example 1:** 89 X 98
*** Step 1: Here base value is 100. So, 89 - 100 = -11 and 98 - 100 = -2
*** Step 2: 89 – 2 = 87 ; 98 -11 = 87
*** Step 3: -2 x -11 = 22
*** Step 4: No carry values
*** Step 5: Append the result is, 89 x 98 = 8722
**Example 2:** 928 X 986
*** Step 1: Here base value is 1000. So, 928 - 1000 = -72 and 986 - 1000 = -14
*** Step 2: 928 - 14 = 986 - 72 = 914
*** Step 3: 14 x 72 = 1008. Here the obtained value is greater than the base value. So carry the one. i.e., 008 (carry 1)
*** Step 4: 914 + 1 = 915
*** Step 5: Append the obtained values, 928 x 986 = 915008

Thus, the vedic maths multiplication for numbers below the base numbers can be done easier.

** Multiply Two Numbers using Vedic Maths Base Method
*** Step 1: Subtract both the numbers from the base value.
*** Step 2: Cross section the multiplier and multiplicand value and add it with the reduced result. You should get same value on both the sides.
*** Step 3: Multiply the reduced values. If the obtained value is greater than the base value, carry the remainder.
*** Step 4: Subtract the remainder value from the difference value and find complement for the reduced result. If you get the carry value again, subtract the one from the difference value.
*** Step 5: Join the obtained value to get the final result.
Multiplication of Numbers Above and Below Base 100
**Example 1:** 92 X 111

Here base value is 100
*** Step 1: 92 – 100 = - 8 ; 111 – 100 = 11,
*** Step 2: 92 + 11 = 103 ; 111 – 8 = 103
*** Step 3: 8 x 11 = 88
*** Step 4: 103 - 1 = 102 Complement of 88 is 12 (100 - 88 = 12)
*** Step 5: Join the values, , 92 X 111 = 10212.
Multiplication of Numbers Above and Below Base 1000
**Example 2:** 985 X 1099

Here base value is 1000
*** Step 1: 985 – 1000 = -15 ; 1099 – 1000 = 99,
*** Step 2: 985 + 99 = 1084 ; 1099 - 15 = 1084
*** Step 3: 15 x 99 = 1485. 15 x 99 = 1485. Here the obtained value is greater than one. Carry the remainder 1.
*** Step 4: 1084 - 1 = 1083. Now again subtract the one from the difference value because we have the carry value one. So the result wil be 1082. Complement of 1485 is 515.(2000 – 1485 = 515)
*** Step 5: Append the resultant values, 985 X 1099 = 1082515
Thus, the vedic maths base method multiplication can be used for faster multiplication.

*** Step 1:
Let us consider subtraction of two 2digit numbers 36 from 62 .
*** Step 2:
Now, split the values 62 and 36 as follows
6 / 2
3 / 6
*** Step 3:
Now, perform simple subtraction between the numbers written splitted
  6 / 2
- 3 / 6
--------
3 / (-4)
*** Step 4:
As we get negative result, we are in need to add 10 with the second digit and subtract 1 with the first digit obtained after subraction.
3 / (-4)
(3-1) / (10-4)
------------
2 / 6
*** Step 5:
Final answer attained is 26.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let us view another example for subtracting two digit numbers
**Example 2:**
*** Step 1:
Select any two 2 digit numbers for example 43 and 26.
*** Step 2:
Subtract '3' from '6' and deduct '4' with '2'.Then write the solutions in their respective place.
4 / 3
2 / 6
--------
2 / (-3)
*** Step 3:
Now pick '2' and subtract 1 from it since the second digit is negative value. Choose (-3) and add '10' to it (10 - 3).
2 / (-3)
(2-1) / (10-3)
-------
1 / 7
*** Step 4:
The final solution obtained is 17.

Cross Multiplying Two Digit Numbers
Cross Multiplying Two Digit Numbers
Problem : 16 x 28
*** Step1:
First, write your problem down, sitting on top of each other, like you would do when multiplying normally.
   1 6
 x 2 8-------
*** Step2:
Multiply the numbers in the ones place and put the product underneath the problem as shown. In this case, 8*6 is greater than 10 (48).  
   1 6
 x 2 8-------
    48
*** Step3:
Cross-multiply the ones with the opposing tens and add them together. In this case, (2*6) + (1*8) = 20. Write 20 underneath 48 one space to the left (ending on the tens column)  
   1 6
 x 2 8-------
    48
    20
*** Step4:
Multiply the tens. 1*2 = 2. Place this product another space to the left, in the hundreds column as shown.
   1 6
 x 2 8-------
    48
    20
    2
*** Step5:
Now, add the products. Add the three rows as you do in normal multiplication method. The sum of the three rows you created equal 448, our answer.
   1 6
 x 2 8-------
    48
    20

* Square  

Vedic Maths Squaring Numbers
Consider squaring 122
*** Step 1:
Choose the last two digits of '122' and add it with the given number 122
=122 + 22
=144
*** Step 2:
Multiply 100 with the above result 144
= 144 x 100
= 14400
*** Step 3:
Now mulitply '22' with '22'
= 22 x 22
= 484
*** Step 4:
Now, add the values obtained from step 2 and step 3.
= 14400 + 484
= 14884
Result:
122^2 = 14884
This Squaring concept is applicable only for three digit numbers from 100 to 200.  

Square a number by the Deficiency Sutra Method
*** ***  1 : Find the base of given number. That is maybe, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, ...
*** Step 2 : Find the difference between base and a given number. That is a deficiency value.
*** Step 3 : Subtract the given number by deficiency and then multiply by base.
*** Step 4 : Square the deficiency value.
*** Step 5 : Add rule 3 result with the rule 4 result. Its a final result.
**Example:** 93 X 93 (Yaavadunam Sutra Method)
*** Step 1 : 93 base is 100
*** Step 2 : 100 - 93 = 7
*** Step 3 : (93 - 7) X 100 = 86 X 100 = 8600
*** Step 4 : 7 X 7 = 49
*** Step 5 : = 8600 + 49 = 8649
 93 X 93 = 8649

* Fraction

Converting Fractions to Decimals
In fraction,
1) denominator value 1's digit must be 9
 2) denominator value must be prime number (19, 29, 39, 59,...)
Calculation Rules :
1) Find the number of digit answer from denominator
n = denominator value - 1
2) First we find the half of the number of digit answer
m = n / 2
3) Find x from denominator value
Remove 1's digit and remaining value (Ekadhikena Purvena) add by 1
4) Always start with 1

5) Now, multiply last find digit to x value, if result is carry occurs to carry the value to next multiplication. Its up to reach m number of digits

6) Next to find the complement of rule 5 results of m digit values.

7) Now write answer from digit in reverse order from rule 6 and rule 5 with decimal point. Its Answer of given fraction value.

**Example:** 1/19
*** Step 1 : n = 19 - 1 = 18
*** Step 2 : m = 18 / 2 = 9
*** Step 3 : x = 1 (Ekadhikena Purvena - digit previous to 9) + 1 = 2
*** Step 4 : = 1 (first digit)
*** Step 5 : = 1, (first digit)
 1 * 2 (x) = 2,
 2 * 2 = 4,
 4 * 2 = 8,
 8 * 2 = 16 (carry 1) = 6,
 6 * 2 = 12 + 1 = 13 (carry 1) = 3,
 3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7,
 7 * 2 = 14 (carry 1) = 4
 4 * 2 = 8 + 1 = 9
 (m number of digits find i.e., 9 digits)
*** Step 6 : 1 2 4 8 6 3 7 4 9
 Complement (minus from 9) of this result is,
 8 7 5 1 3 6 2 5 0
*** Step 7 : digit in reverse order
 0.052631578947368421
  Result :
 1/19 = 0.052631578947368421
