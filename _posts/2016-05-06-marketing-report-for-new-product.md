Introduction 
Cat Scrap®  by Oli-Dry Corporation
Gone are the days of pet owners dreading pet litter cleaning; Cat Scrap®, the bestselling kitty litter does away with the angst associated with this daily task. Consumers have an increased awareness of environmental benefits and they look for a multi-use product. These requirements have been major factors that have led to the success of Cat Scrap® through innovative developments such as additional ingredients in the manufacturing process that allow waste to be disposed of into the garden activating nutrients when waste comes in contact with soil. Providing added benefits of improved growth rates for garden plants and increased yields of farmed products along with the odour free and simple to maintain original products attributes. 







Current Marketing Status
Market Segment: 
In Australia RSPCA (2016) estimate that over 60% of Australian households own pets, dominated by Dog and Cat owners. The market has revenues of $4.3 billion and a projected growth rate of 2.8% as mentioned by industry analyst Richardson (2016). Actuals product sales for 2015-16 are currently at $240 million within the market segment of retail pet products; furthermore according to the analysis done by Richardson (2016) there is considerable potential for further expansion. As the product is in a mature stage of the product lifecycle, in part described as: “A slowdown in sales growth because the product has achieved acceptance by most potential buyers...” (Kotler 2014, p 391), this report will discuss how the product can change direction from having a Growth-Slump-Maturity pattern to a Cycle-Recycle-Pattern. In short niche animal healthcare products within the retail pet products segment is still growing. 
Distribution: 
Oli-Dry Corporation has a significant wholesale distribution network which accounts for 85% of their current revenue, indirectly selling to over 1500 retail business in the Australian region. Oli-Dry Corporations have a long term approach to the retail industry and as such have adopted new approaches to customer and supplier satisfaction through building relationships and increasing the value offering to both. Research indicates that there are in fact three perspectives of customer value; based on satisfaction, value and loyalty (Sugiati 2013). There is a clear connection between these three factors and from this the fundamental message is related to buyer-seller interaction where value is created through relationships and building on the core value delivery process. This report will further discuss approaches for enhancing the product offering, improving the customers perceived value with intention to increase the customer lifetime value whilst bundling strong relationships between distribution suppliers and the customer.  
Product Competition: 
Competition is at a medium level and Richardson (2016, p.4-5) states, 'Online retail is providing increasing competition for the industry as consumers can find some products at lower prices online'. The current market is dominated by three major competitors having an estimated combined revenue of 46% of the industry total, being within NSW, VIC and QLD. Despite having a strong foothold in the niche market there is a chance of interruption to the demand and use of Cat Scrap®. In summary, there is potential for growth, but it is clear there are obvious threats which this report will analyse in conjunction with any opportunities.

SWOT Analysis 
We analyse key strengths and weaknesses inside of Oli-Dry Corporation as well consider any external opportunities and threats. Using a checklist form to perform strengths and weaknesses analysis, as suggested by Kotler (2014, p 59), has aided in fully understanding the company's strengths and weaknesses.
Opportunities:
Utilising innovative product features that focus on environmental benefits, the potential to enter the Horticulture industry will be a significant opportunity to take advantage of. 
As suggested earlier there is expected growth within the current targeted market as it is continually growing and allows for expanded market share, broadening our reach to include other demographics, such as a pet owners with lower disposable incomes is another opportunity. 
Oli-Dry Corporation recognises that investing in the buying process and offering additional services with more technical information available aimed at the new segments will increase the rate of customer adoption.
With a significant investment in the marketing budget there will be multiple new channels considered when creating a marketing plan, aiming for a broad impact within the new market whist contributing to an integrated marketing approach and still benefiting the current market.
The addition of new packaging will have the advantage of being fresh, building on the brand equity to create awareness in a new way using various strategies discussed further in this report.
Threats:
As alluded to above, the increased move by consumers to online purchasing may cause some disruption, however due to the size and nature of Cat Scrap® it is considered a relatively small threat. Indirect competition from the three larger companies offering wider product ranges through superstore facilities may attract existing customers and lead them to buy elsewhere.
Oli-Dry Corporation must pay close attention to the new targeted segment and learn about big players, their strategies and industry trends; and whilst being a newcomer to the market there is risk that is will be slow uptake in getting brand awareness. 
Strengths:
Cat Scrap® has excellent brand acceptance and customer retention, in addition having strong brand stature has allowed the product to become a trusted product within market. This a significant advantage when entering new markets as the positioning can take advantage of brand strengths and equity. 
The uniqueness of the product will benefit marketing campaigns as multi-use products and reducing environmental impact are appealing to a wider consumer audience than any competing products; this is due to a strong differentiation. 
With distinct points of difference the company has a significant advantage over competition despite there being some generic points of parity, this remains a big drawcard for suppliers purchasing the product as they will take advantage of these benefits to sell more product.
Weaknesses:
At this time there is a lack of marketing strategies, however this report aims to overcome that by setting clear goals and discussing new marketing strategies.
Reliance on brand awareness will not necessarily help enter new market segments, to date this factor has been used to the company's advantage but will need to stop. 
Oli-Dry Corporation does not have a dedicated marketing team; it will required to engage marketing agencies to help launch advertising campaigns. 
Approaching a new market segment as a new comer will be a considerable weakness to overcome.



Marketing Objectives
Benefiting from the SWOT analysis Oli-Dry Corporation will focus on the following goals.
Sales Volume Goals: 
Richardson states 'Discretionary incomes influence expenditure...such as food and cat litter...”Over the past five years, higher household discretionary income has translated into greater expenditure on pet-care products”'. This is encouraging and supports an expectation for increased turn-over in 2015-16, as such Oli-Dry Corporation will aim for revenues to reach $265 million in the next 12 months being an increase of 7.5% over the previous financial year.  Furthermore, with entry into new markets, an increase of revenue to an estimated $295 million will be the objective. In summarising; there is a high likelihood that these gaols will be achievable based on industry trends. 
Market Share Goals: 
When considering market share and using information provided earlier in this report, these goals will be achievable through aggressive marketing strategies. There is the added potential for increased market share by entering into the horticulture segment which currently has an industry revenue of $1.28 billion and growth projection is 10-15% for the coming years (Monk, A; Mascitelli, B, Australian Organic Market Report, Publication No. 12/06, p.7). Oli-Dry Corporation have set the expected increase to include an additional 3000 retail/wholesale outlets within Australia. 
Does evidence support focusing on new segments and concentrated efforts to secure new customers? Well to fully understand the best way to engage new customers there is every reason that the Free Cat Scrap® promotion, discussed in the strategies below, will bring a new level of brand awareness that can be supported and built on over the next three to five years. In short it is fair to expect that the size of the markets and anticipated growth will support these goals.
Profit Goals: 
Whilst there will be significant investment for the forthcoming financial period, the resulting revenue increase will justify the new approach to integrated marketing strategies. With the addition of the horticulture segments it is likely that there will be increases to Oli-Dry Corporation profit margins. Additionally, considering the new market, profit goals are expected to increase to $145 million within the first 12 months and have an estimated compounded growth of 5.8%.
Oli-Dry Corporation believe that within the horticulture industry there is a higher level of competition meaning that prices are competitive due to consumers being in a strong bargaining position. The problem with price competition is that it can reduce profit margins and has potential to turn products into a commodity. By adding to the service provided, the offering will be held in higher regard and should justify the approach toward projected increases in revenue. As for the pet market is is suggested that: “the industry is forecast to continue along its strong growth path over the next five years” Anderson(2016), combined with this industry statistic: 'Almost half (48%) of all Australians would like to either get a pet or get another pet'.(http://www.ava.com.au/news/media-centre/hot-topics-4).This gives confidence that this is the time for aggressive marketing strategies and execution of those plans in a timely manner.
Marketing Strategies 
Product: 
The product is generally considered as non-durable goods. It has capacity to reach new markets based on product innovations and additional industry benefits in line with the opportunities suggested.  If the article in (Mass Market Retailers Vol. 31 Issue 12, p22-22) about the 'Litter Genie Cat Litter Disposal System' is accurate then one would agree that there is interest in new and innovative products for this market, this adds weight to current success of Cat Scrap® and strongly indicates success for the future. This is definitely inline with an opportunity raised earlier that the company can take advantage of their product innovation. As far as the new market is concerned a new approach will be required and further to the suggestion of new packaging, by introducing this aspect into advertising campaigns it is expected to pave way for the brand to be accepted quite rapidly.
The customer value hierarchy considers Cat Scrap® as an augmented product within the retail pet products industry and a potential product within the horticulture industry segment. 
As such taking advantage of product differentiation will benefit when entering the new horticulture market.
Price: 
Taking advantage of the perceived value pricing, the current pricing model will be of product line pricing and vary within each respective market. An interesting statistic as written in (Supermarket News 2015 p70) states cat/dog litter trends: 'with increased supermarket sales and topping the top 10 list of Nonfood New Products'. What can be taken from this, well it suggests that yet again there is strong demand for products of this type. It is therefore another justification to keep the prices on par with current pricing levels and to use this as an entry point for the new market; despite it being a different segment.
As noted above and benefiting from the strength of the product there will be advantages to having an aggressive pricing strategy for entry into the new market. 
Within the communication mix there will be details of a promotion which will come at significant cost to the company, however, to expect anything less than a good return on investment would be inaccurate according to industry trends.
To summarise, Cat Scrap® will remain at the higher end of market pricing thus supported by strong consumer brand trust.

Place: 
Benefiting from recognised internal strengths and opportunities there is a strong indicator that distribution is a profitable outlet, however it is common knowledge in the new marketing of today that there are newer areas to be exploited, including but not limited to online store fronts, click-to-brick and direct sales through company outlet stores. The product placement will continue with retail outlets and a click-to-brick initiative and increase the effort to grow the online store front to support direct sales to individual retailers. This decision will help to gain maximum segment penetration within the timeframe mentioned in the goals. Online capabilities will be further enhanced to support product sales and marketing strategies by offering new and improved product information and technical data sheets, to help and benefit new users, particularly within the horticulture industry. Parker, M. (2016) summarises that 'Offline social media is an under-used strategy that can give excellent results', this being another area for which will be explored.
Promotion:
Communication Objective: 
There will be a push strategy to increase brand awareness within the new targeted segment. Brand recognition and enhancing the brand attitude will be pivotal to success, whilst Identifying consumer responses and reacting accordingly will allow for changes to advertising so as to align with consumer needs and wants. Following a successful campaign by 'Cat's Pride® Fresh & Light', it can be argued that a free product promotion in September of this year will create the brand awareness and give access to take advantage of the opportunities shown in the SWOT analysis. Additionally engaging in community events and through local sponsorships will increase brand equity and further add to the product strengths also indicated in the earlier SWOT analysis. 
Communication Channels: 
Through the use of social media platforms, Google AdWords and printed promotional advertising in conjunction with viral online advertising, these channels will be considered and support previous mentions of such channels trending upwards and gaining significant popularity, as such it will be a wise move to start benefiting now.
Promoting the free product launch to raise public awareness will provide a wide broadcasted message though advertising agencies that will push the environmental aspects of the product. This will be achieved through non personal approaches and enhanced by having a well-known celebrity endorse the products and appear on the promotional materials used as point of sales in retail outlets and on the newly designed packaging as mentioned earlier. As a result of the online activity it is expected that there will be benefits from online advertising in the form of indirect word of mouth. There will be some re-enforcement advertising for the pet industry also, to confirm to current customers that the product is continually improving and that it is still their best option.
Communication Marketing Mix: 
With a broad mix of advertising approaches at the company's disposal, each specific segment including consumers, communities, wholesale distributors and retail outlets will benefit from a customised marketing campaign. The marketing campaigns will continue for 6 to 12 months dependent on responses from consumers and distributors. There is speculation that long term campaigns are too costly and with reacting to consumer and industry trends changes can cause a significant loss of potential revenue lost to wasted campaigns that have to be cancelled. As such keeping the campaign short will allow the company to gauge the success and reassess every 6 months.
Strengthened by an earlier point made, companies who engage in offline social media strategies build relationships to a wider customer base, they are therefore more likely to have stronger sales pipelines and to achieve the goals and targets set. Offline channels should allow controlling the quality of exposure rather than purely based on quantitive metrics.
It is worth pointing out some of the key points around the free promotional campaign.
The concept is to introduce the product to the new horticulture market, taking advantage of opportunities detailed in the SWOT analysis, most specifically utilising the product innovations to gain fast entry into the new market and immediately gaining brand awareness. During this promotion the product will be at no cost to customers and include a rebate offer on the packaging where the customer can return to the place of purchase to receive rewards which will contribute to free product over a period of time.
The methods above are in line with the goals for sales volume as the product positioning will be strong enabling increases to profits equal or greater to the goals set out previously.
Conclusion 
In conclusion, having a unique product with multiple uses is attractive to the consumer, however there will be considerable effort from staff and sales teams to engage with the right intermediaries and incorporate an integrated marketing approach to win over new customers, however with the internal strengths noted, reaching the goals set out within this report are feasible and realistically set.
